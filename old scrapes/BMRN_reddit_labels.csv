Is there a tl;dr version? TYIA,0
"Per ChatGPT:

BioMarin, a biopharmaceutical company, has provided an update on the FDA review of its gene therapy, ROCTAVIAN (valoctocogene roxaparvovec), for the treatment of severe hemophilia A in adults. The FDA has extended the review period for the therapy by three months to June 26, 2023. The extension is due to the FDA's need for additional time to review the company's responses to questions related to its BLA (Biologics License Application). BioMarin plans to work closely with the FDA to address any questions and provide the necessary data to support the approval of ROCTAVIAN.",1
But will it cost up the ass or how will people get access to it?,-1
Bi9marin provide more longterm data from their trial.  FDA has delayed their decision since it needs time to review the new material.,-1

Is this the one that's the $3.5M shot and then back to severe in 6 or so years?,-1

"> [The high list prices of gene therapies command the media’s attention and that of policymakers and payers. Late last year, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the world’s first gene therapy for severe and moderately severe hemophilia B; Hemgenix (etranacogene dezaparvovec). Hemgenix will have a list price of $3.5 million per use, which sets a new record for the most expensive single-use gene therapy. Then there’s Roctavian (valoctocogene roxaparvovec), indicated for severe hemophilia A. This gene therapy may be approved by FDA as soon as early spring. Its list price is expected to be around $2.5 million per single-use.](https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2023/02/16/when-launched-gene-therapy-roctavian-will-be-administered-mainly-in-340b-eligible-treatment-centers-where-it-will-be-substantially-discounted-in-price/)",-1
tldr: yes,1
Efficacy endpoint meaning factor levels are optimal at the end of the 3 years?,1
When would this be made available?,0
"The three endpoints/outcomes are listed in the table in the press release. It might help to look at the description of the [clinical trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03392974) to better understand the outcomes they were looking at:

It has already been approved by regulators in the EU. It seems like they're hoping to get approval from the FDA in the US this year. How long it takes after these approvals before you can actually get dosed is unclear.,1
Priced around $1.9million.,0
"They’ve made progress on Licence application. But how well does it work? Or more accurately, how difficult and 
risky and how many side effects will come with it? And for how long? From what I understand “curing” hemophilia this way is worse than having hemophilia. But I could be wrong. I don’t know enough about it. What I have seen seems like something I’d rather not go through myself. Should I be more optimistic?",-1
Compared to 600k per year now. Thats a steal almost,-1
"Factor over a lifetime is much more expensive. It really wouldn't be that big of a fight with insurance companies if it brings up and sustains factor levels to near normal levels and eliminates the need for factor replacements. If you are on prophylaxis, you probably spend that in a couple years. 

I'm also pretty sure the other option of hemlibra is pretty expensive as well, although I don't know the actual cost. I know most insurance wouldn't cover it as a mild so it has to be more than factor replacements.

Also remember the facilities, technology, and people doing the work developing these need to be compensated as it is not something that is very easy or streamlined currently. It also allows profit to keep advancing it and will likely get to the point that you will be cured before you are even born for the future generations. Wouldn't that be great to have our struggle disappear for future generations?",1
Oh well,1
"So, affordable then…😅😅😅",0
Does insurance help in any way?,1
My hospital was in preparation to begin offering gene therapy for it's members since all the insurances they have from people who have hemophilia approved of the cost for the treatment. But the FDA wanted more trails so we have to wait a bit more.,1
[deleted],0
I’m sure they will. My take is that they’ll actually be the preferred treatment once they’re predictable enough. 2-3 mil for a patient to potentially never need factor again or hemlibra again unless they have an injury or surgery versus 1m or more a year for big users? The math makes it an easy financial decision for the insurance companies.,1
"That's why I said ""if"", regardless they need more money and research to make it more effective, so it still will be a help for those that are willing to give it a shot and can have it covered by insurance. 

I know for people like me who have shown inhibitors, we are probably not going to be candidates for it since our immune system will probably make it almost useless. Mine attacks my natural factor now and brought me from 11% to 2% so I'm probably not going to have the option at all.",1
[deleted],0
I don't have high hopes without messing up my immune system big time by suppressing it. The inhibitors are effecting my natural factor so I think it will overcomplicate matters.,0
I still don’t understand why an adcomm is not of interest with such cutting edge tech.,-1

They have a way now for a single use injection basically that allowed the body to start producing factor VIII by itself,0

For a bit at least. The expression does seem to wear off slowly after a few years - although there isn't really much long term data.,0

Nice find!,1
"I work for a Htc, have seen the data.  This product is not all that, patients have to be monitored super closely, meaning weekly or monthly visits at the least.  No booze either, and high chance of getting out on steroids.",1
I wonder what they mean by “Works”?,0
"If this works as well or better than Hemlibra, look for insurance companies to start pushing it. $2m-$3m for a procedure that could cut hemophilia costs from a million a year to a couple hundred thousand or less per year for the life of the patient is a no-brainer for the insurance companies. If it’s safe and effective, I’d be all fort it for myself.",1
"The efficacy is clearly there. Only some patients required steroids to mediate high liver enzyme levels since the drug targets the liver, but this lasts for a fraction of the duration one is supposed to see clinical benefit. Post monitoring will likely always be less intense than in clinical trials but patients with prior risk factors may need higher frequency (I.e History of fatty liver disease, HCC, hep C etc.) for good measure. A gene therapy for severe hem A is exciting, truly first of its kind and will be one of the first gene therapies approved on the market.",1
"> patients have to be monitored super closely, meaning weekly or monthly visits at the least

Yes but only for a number of months after dosing, right? It's not forever.

> No booze either, and high chance of getting out on steroids.

I think this is going to be true for any product that is based on a viral vector that does nonintegrating gene transfer.",1
">Details are still scarce, as approval decisions loom for Roctavian

I imagine it's gotta be FVIII levels and/or X number of bleeds.",1
"If you have the time, I tell patients to go for it.  I don’t know anyone that can take time off work each month to do this therapy.  

In the end, it’s a unproven product that only works for maybe 30% of the population?",0
"> I don’t know anyone that can take time off work each month to do this therapy.

I don't know what the post-dosing surveillance protocol is going to be for the approved product, but I think there's some chance it could be less intense than what was done in the clinical trials. And I think most of it is just drawing blood to run LFT and factor activity level. I hope patients will have the option of a nurse coming to them to draw the blood.

> product that only works for maybe 30% of the population

Citation needed.",1
How much time are we talking about here and why is that time needed? Does gene therapy work likethe MRNA vaccines?,0
My understanding is that gene therapy is a one-time infusion; the follow-up monitoring is laboratory blood draws (maybe at LabCorp orQuest).,0
I just wanna say thank you for keeping us up to date on hemophilia healthcare news,1
"There were questions why biomarin didn’t present on their mean F8 levels after the 2 year results.  

If you want to follow and get good up to date info, I recommend following Prof Makris on Twitter.  He’s at isth, and retweet’s most presentations.

"I applaud biomarin for holding off on submission, as clinicians have said, there isn’t enough long term data.  There is major concern on durability, this could take longer until fda approval",1
It seems that FDA taken large amount of money from grenetech. They might intentionally not allowing biomarin product to come. They know if it comes then hemlibra market will collapse.,-1

"This is so exciting for the hemophilia community.

FYI if you are only seeing the abstract as opposed to the full article, you can sign up to gain access to a limited number of free articles every month.",1
I mean even if it only kept me symptom free for 5 years that's better than what I deal with now and I'm borderline mild.,1
"Not surprising at all, this has been one of my chief complaints about gene therapy in its current form for the last few years. Everything is being rushed and the costs/negatives will be pushed to the patients as usual. I’d rather have a durable, trustworthy product than take the “first to market” product. The pharma companies are only worried about their bottom line and keeping hemophiliacs as their cash cows.",-1
"Thanks for sharing.

Gotta wonder what the incentive is for these huge biofirms to create a one time ""cure.""   Our medications are stupid expensive.  And genentech, baxter, etc, make a killing off us.

You mean there's a shred of humanity left?    Did the billionaires become happy about going to space and having their gold plated shark tanks?   Heh",1
The only way to prove a gene therapy product is durable is to wait. Should they wait until all the clinical trial subjects have either stopped expressing factor or died of old age?  What's the right amount of time to wait?,-1
"Honestly , if I suffered from this.  I’d take this right now….. time to live lifeb!",0
I don't think they're doing it out of the goodness of their hearts. I think they see startup firms advancing new technology that will eventually disrupt their markets.  So they partner with or buy the startups so that they're the ones getting $1MM-3MM per one-time treatment. They also get experience with a new technology that may possibly be used to treat a wide range of conditions.,1
They'll just make it cost a million dollars.... Kind of what they do for CAR-T cell therapy for lymphoma.,0
"Because whoever develops a cure first has a monopoly. Takeda, or Genentech, or Behring or any of the other big names could dump every single unit of factor product they have nationwide and still make a huge profit with a cure.",1
and there it is.   Makes sense.   Testing new technologies on the few to ramp them up on the many,0
Wouldn't the cure-discovering company just trash it? Why would they kill the goose that lays the golden eggs? Yes at one point factor pricing was equivalent to gold pricing pound for pound.,-1
The tricky part with any of these treatments right now is that not everyone is a good candidate for the treatments depending on the delivery method.,-1
I get the impression that you think this is problematic?,-1
" - Realistically there would still be tons of people using factor who would for some reason or another be unable to receive the cure. 

 - No one can compete with a true cure. Company XYZ's fancy new factor product may get improved on and largely pushed out of the market but not a true cure. 

 - They can also just charge whatever price they want and insurance companies would pay for it. Compared to the long term costs of factor drug, specialist visits, ER visits, etc.. even at a cost of a $1 million that can easily become profitable to pay for for many patients.",1
It's the way the world works,0

"I just chopped down two 3 Bears OG plants and am now learning how to dry and cure.  My 3 Bears OG plants had many leafy nugs.  I am hoping with a proper curing, my nugs will become more dense and stop smelling like chlorophyll.  I had to wash my plants because they had some powdery mildew on them.  I used hydrogen peroxide, lemon squeezed lemon juice, baking soda and water to wash my buds and then I hung them to dry under a small fan.  Once all the water that could fall off the plants was off, I did a wet trim (which I think was a mistake). I then re-hung the plants in a cardboard box.  They dried up really fast.  The trimmed nugs became super dry over the course of 3 days.  I panicked and chopped the leafy nugs off the stems, put the nugs in 2 large mason jars and put boveda packs in the jars. I am waiting for some moisture to make its way back into the nugs.  I heard people say that boveda packs rejuvenates dry nugs. This is all a big trial and error process for me and it is only day 3!",1
You lucky sob!!!!,1
"How much you get dried? Very interested... you got a journal or anything to share of the grow... I kept one with pics just aint learned how to upload, sounded like some not so fun stuff with cleaning the plant before drying. ... because of weather mine dried in less than 3 days(ugg) I put in paper bag for 2 days, then denugged and jar for cure, smoking it now...very tasty",0
"I just did a weigh of my two 3 Bears OG plants' yield and it was 235 grams or 8.25 ounces.  I wanted to be sure I had the correct weight so I measured a known quantity on my scale and the scale accurately weighed out the known quantity.  So my 2 plants gave me 8.25 ounces although I will do a final weigh in 3 weeks and see where the weight is at after a proper cure. 

Unfortunately, I did not do a grow journal but I plan to do a grow journal on my next grow where I will be growing Double Grape, Strawberry Nuggets, Ripley's OG, 24 Carat, Skywalker, Northern Cheese Haze, Hubbabubbasmelloscope, Sour Stomper & ManBearAlienPig.

Yea, this is probably a frankenstein, but if it really creates factor 8, instead of just creating a bridge between factors 9 and 10 to continue the clotting cascade, I WANT IN!!    Heh",1
"I wouldn’t get your hopes up. I’m usually really optimistic about things, but when I looked into the trials for gene therapy it looked like a pretty brutal process. It’s probably not something I would go thru even if it did promise to raise my level. I’d like to hear from people who have done it and see what they say. The one guy I was following had a pretty rough time, and I’m not sure his levels remained steady.",1
"Wow... Yea, I know nothing about the rigors of gene therapy...

I just know that hemlibra is good, but has some serious problems for me.",-1
Oh wow what problems have you had with Hemlibra?,1
"very odd ones.  Maybe it's because I'm older.

If I hold an isometric pose, like in yoga, and put a lot of stress on a singular muscle, it will feel like I have a bleed and be very tight.  Inflammation to an EXTREME amount.  I've had to treat such issues with regular factor.

I've also had the tear ducts in my eyelids form chalazions - ESPECIALLY after the few ""loading doses.""   They required minor surgery to get rid of.

In most people, a chalazion clears itself...  Not the ones I've had.  And I've never had anything like these except the month after I started hemlibra.  Then, I walked into a spider web, and rubbed my eye too hard.   Almost overnight, a hard lump formed.  

And this has happened more than once.   Three times.  

So, yea...  I think the muscle problems are more of an issue of my concern, but this drug combines factor 9 and 10...  That HAS to be problematic in some clotting circumstances.   I feel I've found 2.  Sure, they are anecdotal, but I can make them happen over and over if I wanted to.",0
"Good to know. I had something weird when I was done with the loading dose. My joints, especially my fingers, seemed swollen and were sore. So I thought it would help to take it weekly, instead of one big dose every two weeks. I felt like the big dose all at once made it worse. Doing the weekly helped. I did have tendinitis in both elbows within the first 6 months, which seemed to me like a strange swelling thing. It was like a bleed but different. But that finally cleared up and otherwise I’ve been happy with it. I still need to infuse a once or twice a month because I beat myself up. And I’m getting old. But so far so good. Hemlibra has cut down my infusions by 75% at least. I still couldn’t exist without factor tho. I’d fall apart pretty quick.",1

"I can't really say as I haven't bought any of their products but I've read some complaints about them some years ago. 

Anyway, I had a weird experience with one of their agents at the sm north way back 2015 or 2016.  I think the shop's name was Origani and they were trying to sell me manuka honey skin products. A foreign-looking girl invited me to their shop to test their products and before I knew it, I was stuck there listening to her for what seemed like eternity. After demonstrating how the products work and giving me lots of their product flyers, she asked me if I had an atm/debit/credit card with me. I said yes. She asked to see it and I showed her one of my cards. She then inquired if I was a government employee (must be the landbank atm card lol) and she looked disappointed when I answered yes. Well, can't blame her. Most people think government employees=poor. Unless you're a politician. Haha. 

I remember her telling me that she'll offer one product to me at a very discounted price-a whooping 11k for a jar of moisturizer (?) and she'll even add a freebie. And I remember declining her offer and telling her that I was supposed to have my hair curled at one of the salons there, had I not been waylaid by her. She then candidly asked me if I was sure I wanted to prioritize my hair over my very dry skin. She stressed this a lot of times. Haha. IMO, my skin wasn't really dry. I actually have better-than-average skin, if I may so. But this foreigner (who was surprisingly good at speaking tagalog) kept on telling me I had dry skin and I needed to prioritize it over my hair. As in paulit-ulit kami! Haha. 

I actually had no intention of buying any of their overpriced products but what sealed it for me was her pushiness.  I recall seeing some of the filipino salesladies looking apologetic at us, as if somehow, they, too didn't agree with the foreign sales agent's method. She then further reduced the price to 5k, but I still declined. Had I not been planning a trip that week, I might have just given in to her offers as it was really exhausting repeatedly declining her offer. But I had a budget to stick to, and a hair that needed urgent make-over, so I knew there was just no more room for unnecessary expenses. 

She must have sensed that she couldn't convince me as she started being cold and condescending. I apologized one last time and took one of those flyers she has been giving me earlier, telling her I'll just review the flyers later and study their products more. To my shock, she snatched the flyers from my hand (as in malakas na hablot), haughtily told me those flyers were exclusive for members and walked away, leaving me standing there in shock. Feeling ko napahiya talaga ako. I didn't see any point in refusing to give me the flyers as she was practically pushing those at me earlier. 

I just left the store confused after that. She must have have hated wasting at least 30mins with me, without me buying any of their overpriced products. I got curious about them after that encounter and started searching about their company. I discovered that my experience wasn't unique and there were really people who swiped their card for 3-4 months worth of their salary without realizing why they did it. Some of these people recognized their mistake and tried to return the products and get a refund the next day, but sadly, I think most of them  failed. I'm still not sure if it is a scam or these sales agents just have really strong convincing powers, bordering budol-budol levels.",1

* All the foreigners I knew (from the head honchos to the salesmen) were NOT on tourist visas. They all have work visas and ARC cards. Some reports also say na it's like 4 foreigners to a condo unit and it's similar to human trafficking. Fuck no. These dudes had 1 unit each in the swankiest condos in BGC. By swanky I mean nothing lower than Arya or Essensa. Yan, ni-name drop ko na. HAHAHAHA. So in that sense, they were here legally and operated in humane conditions. 
* Products themselves worked great esp the scrubs and stuff with Manuka.
* NOW to the budol part, they are known for extreme sales tactics na tinuturo talaga sa classes world wide. These are all mostly under ONE umbrella company. Usually one investor lang yan iba iba lang pangalan. Kaya minsan ung tindero sa Kedma andun din sa Origani andun din sa Fashion TV. These tactics while not illegal, are seen as harrassment in most cultures. Take note, these guys are usually from gulf origin meaning in their country THIS IS NOT OFFENSIVE. 
* Salary is based on commission and regular base pay. To be quite fair, they treat their Filipino counterparts and employees amazingly well. Palaging may pakain, perks, training and all. 
* Items have ceiling prices. So yung binebentang 100K na yan ang real price is 50K, so they can keep playing with the pricing strat basta di babagsak sa 50K. 
* They are extremely well trained in spotting vulnerable people who will bend to their will. If you do not want them to approach you, you must be as aggressive as they are. Tandaan mo, bansa natin to. If di ka tantanan say ""lo toda"" which basically means ""no thank you"". They respond better to firmness rather than ""o sige"" I'll try mentality.

"I had a crazy experience kanina. This happened in Ayala Central Bloc Cebu. The saleslady was kind. She made me try products but she was not pushy at all. Then, her manager came suddenly. Dun na, she was so pushy. She tried to convinced me by offering a lot of discounts and freebies and lower prices offering. I was like sort of hypnotized. I didn't have money though. I only have like 3k in my card, then she said I could just give her 1k downpayment tapos yung 12k to be followed na. She asked for my card. I gave it to her then she just suddenly swiped it without my consent. I asked her what she was doing then wanted my card back. When she gave it back, I immediately ran fast haha. Almost got scammed though. What a horrible experience indeed!!!!",1
"I should have seen this thread before. My fault too for not being to so aggressive with my ""no"", they were really pushy and really targeted insecurities of my skin and body. I purchased their product worth 7.9k daw 5k nalng lahat. I also got wellness freebies from them like facial, wellness cocoon pod, at EMS. Now I'm hesitant to ask for a refund kasi I availed all freebies right after I purchased the products. I feel so bad purchasing something so expensive that I didnt even truly research on if this product is gonna be good for my skin.

anyone of you have similar experience, like consuming the freebies and went to file for refund? I would also want to push through with refund kahit 75% of it lang mabalik sakin, but I'm also scared to go back to the store, nakaka trauma.",-1
"They have decent products naman (although di nla ako customer kasi i dont want fragrance or unnecessary plant extracts or whatever in my skincare) pero overprice tlaga sla, ganun sila ka pushy kasi super laki ng commission na nkukuha nla. I know this since my coworker’s gf is working in their company hr dept. not a scam it’s really just pure business,super motivated lang sila bec of the big commision they can get (they can earn 30k up to 100k a month commi daw) kaya parang nanghoholdap na ,its up to you naman if kakagat ka or you really like their products, pero madami na din daw sila regular customers",1
Deceptive and incredibly pushy. We filed a complaint against them thru DTI-FTEB and we were awarded a full refund of the money they took from us forcefully for a lack of better word.,0
"My mother fell into their trap and availed of an 80,000-peso package. She took us with her for the first session. During the procedure, they kept coercing my father to buy a device worth 400,000. They. Won't. Stop. Didn't even let him relax. What a horrible experience. 🤦‍♀️",0
"I’ll share an experience from my mom’s view and my view from these two vendors (Origani and Black pearl)

From Origani she bought a day cream, night cream and a scrub but those three didn’t work and the thing those 3 products were like 10k. 

Now from Black pearl in the first time we went to there in city of dreams I remember the workers there were quite pushy :/ they insisted on getting us to buy this seeweed (I think) salt scrub from my older brother who has really sensitive skin (eczema basically) which was good for sensitive skin but the thing is he’s allergic to salt scrubs. I think we did bought another product but I can’t remember the 2nd one actually from the first time my mom bought there. But yeah my mom ended up buying those two which were really expensive. When my older brother tried it it ended up making his skin worse actually and not only that but my mom also tried the salt scrub too and also made her skin worse like AS IN very worse. Also that 2nd product I remember was bad too :/

But the only good experience I have from black pearl in the 2nd time was today actually when we were just city of dreams again walking around til suddenly a woman approached us (good thing she wasn’t that type of pushy person but just handed us which my mom ended up getting the sample) since my mom and brother tried it and the results was actually nice ngl we ended up going back to the lady and ended up buying the product and I’m just gonna be honest but the lady was really nice and gave my mom a free facial  and my mom appreciated the lady a lot (the hand cream ended up actually being a body lotion this whole time but it was nice and it smells good) it was expensive honestly but yeah this was the first time it was a good experience from those kinds of Dead Sea products honestly. 

I wish every worker who works on those kinds of Dead Sea brands was like that lady we just met today honestly like she wasn’t pushy or anything but just handed us not really expecting anyone buying any of the products but just letting any people that pass her if they want to get it or not :(",1
"Sa mga na scam, mag sama sama tayo at mag complain sa DTI ang pitch natin ay DECEPTIVE SELLING. May nabasa ako same ng cases natin at successful sila na irefund ung pera nila dahil naging mediator nila si DTI. At nag sulat ang DTI na pinagmulta nila ng 300k si Sea of Spa. I don't know bakit meron parin sila boutique sa mga malls 😡",-1
"Hi! I’d like to share my experience with Origani and hopefully this could help everybody with their refund. 

I was also scammed by them last year. They took about P80,000 from, they did the same pushy sales tactic and me as an introvert couldn’t say no to their offers at that moment. 

Trigger warning (Minor harassment)❗️ 

They were pushy with having me avail their free facial that day so I went inside their facial room eme tapos their boss tried to build rapport and began to sales pitch their membership. While asking me to buy that, he was always my touching my thighs which really made me uncomfortable. 

After an hour I caved in and bought their lifetime membership para matigil na ang lahat. I went home realising I my savings for something so unreasonable kalokaaa 

I wasn’t able to ask for a refund because I had to go to my province for a few days but immediately went back to the store to return their things and hopefully get my money back. 

The boss’ usual friendly demeanour was gone when I told him I wanted a refund back, but they said that a change of mind isn’t a valid reason. 

But during that week I was in the province, I saw this post and did my research about them and their scummy sales tactic. I argued with him for a couple more times and decided that I will file a report to DTI if they didn’t return my money. 

He tried to even gaslight me that day and say that no one from DTI would entertain my request. Thankfully my mom and my sister was with me in the store because THEY PULLED A KAREN (which is a good thing in this situation lol) because this is where they got Origani’s HR’s contact number to file a complaint. 


In case you wanna skip to how we got the refund here’s how it went:

1. We filed a complain to DTI, and here are the things we made a complaint for: 

- thankfully my sister worked in a bank so she spotted that they need to provide a RECEIPT not a SALES INVOICE. 

- No CCTVs inside their facial room eme (Context: When I was asking for a refund, I asked if their CCTVs are functioning inside the facial room area to prove that he was inappropriately touching me, he said it’s not working)

- Pushy/ deceiving sales tactic

2. Directly went to SM’s management (In our case SM Bacoor) para ireklamo sila, accommodating sila and I told them my bad experience with the boss, scummy sales tactic etc. They even set up a meeting for Origani and my family to meet that night, but they didn’t show up.

3. Contact their HR (constantly lol, my mom didn’t stop pestering them)

Eventually the HR messaged me and say that they’ll return the money in full the day after. They gave everything in cash, made me sign a contract, fire that boss (I doubt it pero who knows).

Yung agreement ata stated that I should overlook this but I don’t fucking care lol they’re a scam and everyone should be aware of purchasing their products/service.",1

"Hi!

My mom got suckered to buy sa City of Dreams naman. They also gave us a free mask/facial service. Pero the staff there were nice kaya siguro nauto sa salestalk un mom ko.

But anyway, if you look online, it's a lot cheaper than what they sell in their physical stores. Same product naman.",1
"Been reading the comments here and oof sketchy af nga. Anyway, so I know someone who's a ""Skin Specialist"" and Branch Owner of Origani (based sa social media niya).  She also posted on her feed na hiring daw sila and 50k to 100k monthly + incentives and bonuses pa daw. Mukhang true yung isang comment dito ah kaya sobrang pushy nila.",1
Paano niyo po na refund. Ako kc worth 94k sa Credit Card ko. Pabelp po. D rin me mkatulog.,-1

"Meron din ako experience.. Origani yung store.. sabi ng staff he will let his Isaraeli boss talk to me.. kaya the boss offered me a 100k one time deal for membership and the machine itself.. was really hesitant kase nga 100k.. original price is 220k for the machine alone at 138k for the membership.. I was about to pay using my card kaya lng nag error kase wrong security password na in ko lol so i end up not being able to pay.. on the day promo lng daw sabi ng boss pero okay daw na bukas ko nlng e pay.. 

I started reading on reddit about this type of scams..kaya the more hesistant I became.. what do you think po of my decision? Scam ba talaga sa tingin niyo?",-1
Hi! Anyone here na nakapagrefund even if more than 2 months na yung purchase?,0
[deleted],0
"Hi I got refunded po in full. Malaking help yung pagshare ng iba sa experiences nila. Eto po yung mga napansin ko, aside sa same ng mga sales pitch at scheme:

1. Iba-ibang business name gamit nila ""branding"" ika nga. Mukhang legit ang physical store at sa malls pa at may website kaya di mo mapapansin sa una. Kung magpaprefund na, magsama kayo ng kakilala pag babalik ng store or pa-assist sa admin ng malls. Buti cooperative ang admin ng SM. 

2. Sa mga nabasa ko na sinabi na nakapagrefund sila by saying na dapat OR ang prinoprovide nila instead of Sales Invoices, totoo yun. And there's more to it. Kung titignan nyong mabuti ang SI at iko-connect kung bakit di sila makapagprovide ng OR ay dahil ang permit na inallow sa kanila ay for SALE OF GOODS, which means wala silang permit to render services like facial treatment or derma services. Plus kung di sila sumusunod sa invoicing requirements, possible na di rin nagdedeclare ng tamang sales na masusubject sa tax. (BIR violation) 

Much worse nagbibigay pa sila ng impression and claims comparing their services sa mga legit na derma clinic, kaya meron talagang namimislead. Additionally, kahit sale of goods (cosmetics) ang line of business nila, dapat may License to Operate pa rin sila from FDA. Iba pa yung certification ng mismong product. May certificate yung ibang product na nakita ko pero yung mismong establishment ay wala. Verify sa site ng FDA, or pwede din tanungin ang mismong store. Under DTI Administrative Order #06 s. 2007, Isa sa mga aggravating circumstances #14 yan. Isearch nyo, pero again dapat may proofs kayo. (FDA violations) 

3. Kung may contract kayo na pinirmahan, at naniniwala kayo na namislead talaga kayo intentionally, pwede nyong icontest yang validity nun. Plus sa video ng pag-unbox kung meron, nagquestion din ako sa intention nila ng pagvid. Apparently, inaanticipate nila ang ganung pangyayari kaya may back up proofs sila. Matatalino ang mga scammer (in a very bad way).

4. Based sa mga story na nabasa ko at sa personal experiences ko, eto pa ang mga violations nila under Consumer Act:

-Provision on deceptive, unfair and unconscionable act/practices

-Provisions on Advertising & Sales Promotion

-Violation of R. A. No. 71 as Amended (Price Tag Law) 

May videos ang DTI sa YT regarding sa mga provisions na yan for guidance.",-1
"No. She doesn't hate you for wasting her time. That's the tactic. They push you to try their products or to have a ""free"" facial. Most people, mahihiya na, not to buy anything. The last resort is they'll be rude to you.

Next time ask for their working permit. Init ng dugo ko sa mga to. My friend spent 150k on them. She's the type na madaling maconvince and nahihirapan mag-no. Like if may lumapit na stranger sa friend ko, nahihirapan syang iignore. We helped her get a refund and threatened to report the company sa DTI.

Tbh, sobrang dami na rin nilang DTI mediations based on what I read. This company doesn't care, because wala namang teeth ang DTI against these practices and most people nahihiya na magcomplain na naloko sila by the thousands. Irerefund nila pero mas madami silang naloloko. Immaterial sa kanila yung narerefund na transactions compared to total sales.",0
This was exactly the same as my experience! (But the clay mask was just 5k - which I thought was already stupidly expensive for a mask),-1
Same happened to me. Napabili ako ng manuka honey exfoliator. In fairness maganda naman kaso 6k grabe. Got a free moisturiser though but I think the exfoliating mask was not worth 6k!,0
"WTFFFFF

omygod buti lang kinaya mong maging kalmado pa niyan. if i were you, i would've made a scene kung napaka-maldita pala ng sales personnel na iyan. a sales person who doesn't respect me isn't worth my time or my money.",-1
"AGREE! May mala mala ganito akong experience in Singapore. Pinay din, sinales talk kami ng bongga ng friend ko with halong chikka. Buti nalang it was at the tail end of our trip, wala na kaming pera HAHAHAHA.",1
Second this. Its the so-called high-pressure sales tactics.,0
"If paiba-iba yung dinedeclare nilang price, based on how easy it is to manipulate a person, then what they're doing is not legal.

They could be violating the Consumer Act of the Philippines. If they're selling it for twice as much as the ""real"" price, RA 7394 states:

""It shall be unlawful to offer any consumer product for retail sale to the public without an appropriate price tag, label or marking publicly displayed to indicate the price of each article and said products shall not be sold at a price higher than that stated therein and without discrimination to all buyers.”

"My mom had a similar experience sa Black Pearl in Okada. It wasn't even just salesperson, they were the owners daw talaga, 2 sila eh. A man and a woman, tas they were telling my mom about how Jinkee pacquiao and other celebs buys from them. Eh syempre oldies are gullible diba so she bought like 18k worth of skincare products and the machine that costed like 60k? I'm not sure na sa price coz it was from a few years back. She ended up not liking the products kasi it wasn't doing anything, and she couldn't get a refund so I was looking at online threads or posts but there really are no reviews on the products. I hope people won't buy any of their stuff na kasi it's most likely a scam.",-1

"Nabuhay ulit ata to after the FB post.

I'm introverted and non-confrontational but when the sales people pulled me aside I spent an hour just saying no in a million ways. Kasama ko boyfriend ko nun so at least may moral support ako. But man they're difficult.

The thing is may effect naman din products nila. My mom has some of their products. Doubts of scams aside, she lets me use them sometimes and wala naman issue. Ang problema lang talaga is yung way of selling nila. Idk if that's how they do it in their country but here it just isnt good.

Nabanggit din sa FB post na yung isang beauty tool nila 50k or 80 ata. Tapos may mga nagsabi na sa Dubai mahal talaga presyo. Ewan.",-1

Hi! I’d like to know if you have any updates on your issue. We’ve also encountered these people and have unfortunately bought their products. I’m interested to know if there is a group that is coordinated and actively moving to get refunds from this store.,1
Good for me then na makapal ang mukha ko. Haha.,1
Super overpriced ng products nila! You can buy a complete set of skincare products from well-known and established brands at a cheaper price. Buti na lang i refuse to spend more than 10k for a jar of moisturizer. Won't even spend 5k for it. Lol,1
"I may have worded it wrong, but from what I know/experienced, when you purchase they give an initial bill shock like 10,000PHP then when they see hesitation or after back and forth, they do a sudden price drop na ""okay I'll give you a discount"" or a mega price drop if you buy it in a package. Idk how they get around that while selling in mall kiosks but you can observe that strat and see if they still do it till now. Nagiiba talaga yung presyo from the initial offer.

Wondering if anyone here experienced said price drop/ offer?

Adding also: Due to a lot of complaints, DAPAT bawal na sila magapproach. Pinoy na ang nag approach - dadalin ka sa store - foreigner takes it from there.   


Read the comment below on DTI, not sure if they have backing there per se but some of them are well connected in the local scene. So... lam na (I'm assuming this part).",-1
"I had no choice because they push me to buy it and I was like ""I'm sorry I really have to go right now because I had a christmas party to attend to"" and then the saleslady said ""no ma'am I will not charge you by just putting a sample product on your skin"" But then later on charged me even if I told them that I didn't bring cash.",-1
"Hi! Same po. We got scammed last Dec. 24. We went yesterday to the store and the SA not there and nasa other branch daw. Tactics rin nila na palipat2 ang mga tao nila. We called the ""head"" daw and nag-ask kami na return namin ang product kasi my itchiness na and we ask to cancel our membership. As in budol sila kasi kapag andon ka mapapakagat ka talaga sa offer nila. Sabi pa niya need pa raw ng med cert. Hindi naman allergic reaction its just that nangati talaga and pag-uwi naghilamos agad ako. We already filed a complaint sa DTI sa CS ng Origani Philippines and sa Australia rin. Sabi ng head samin irereport nya daw ang sinabi namin sa office nila and sa Tuesday pa kami iuupdate kasi wala raw office until today. Ifafight po namin ito kasi big amount ang nascam sa amin.",-1

"Yes. Good for us. I get annoyed when someone's pushy, so palapit pa lang sila, ""no"" na agad ako. I also don't believe we have to be nice all the time and to everyone, so hindi ako yung target market nila.

Initially, I can't believe people would fall for this. How could someone in their right mind spend spend 6 digits on beauty products, in one go, without prior googling.

Pero yung ginagawa nitong sellers na to, almost like extortion or exploitation. Probably, trained sila to spot people who are easy to manipulate and coerce. Yes it's not illegal, but this is wrong. When I happen to pass by and I spot someone na pinupush nila to buy stuff, I tell the person 'scam po yan'. Haha.",-1
"That's what happened to my friend and one of the redditors who commented on the post. Biglang price drop na several thousand pesos below the initial price they offered.

Said friend gushed about a product she tried at the mall and asked if I already tried the stuff she bought (knowing I love everything kaartehan), nagulat ako when she told me how much the products cost. I told her she was scammed and parang nahimasmasan na sya. We asked around for what she can complain to DTI about, based on her story.

Nahanap namin yung Price Tag Law and the Consumer Act, which is applicable to all commodities including those sold in malls. Anyway, tl;dr they refunded her.

I understand that their sales strategy is not illegal and we can't use that as basis for our complaint, but it's really shady intentionally trying to spot vulnerable people to sell overpriced beauty products to.",1

I also paid for it and they seemed genuine for me and the money wasn't that much of a problem coz they offer 12 months to pay (originally 24 months pero ayaw ko Kasi Matagal) so basically 1.2k per session and two person per session and 24 sessions in total Ako I only made two session palang. I thought it was worth of my money for 1.2k para sa skincare para sa dalawang tao and 24 sessions with all the products and all. Should I also do refund? I'm not that strong to this kind of situation. And may irritation Ako sa Isang product nila,-1

"> In a Securities Exchange Commission filing yesterday, California-based biotech BioMarin Pharmaceutical (Nasdaq: BMRN) revealed it has received the European Medicines Agency’s Joint Assessment Report related to the EMA’s ongoing review of the company’s Marketing Authorization Application for ValRox (valoctocogene roxaparvovec) for severe hemophilia A.

> The Report requests that BioMarin submits to the EMA the full 52-week results from the 134 patients in the ongoing Phase III study of valoctocogene roxaparvovec with the 6e13 vg/kg dose.

> The company expects the last patient will reach 52 weeks of follow-up in November 2020, and BioMarin is working with the EMA to enable a potential submission of the requested data by the end of the first quarter of 2021.

> As a result of the EMA’s request, the review of the ValRox MAA has reverted from an accelerated assessment to a standard review. BioMarin plans to provide additional information about its expectations regarding the timing of the MAA review after the company has further interactions with the EMA.

> Approval also delayed in USA

> Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL), recommending that BioMarin completes the Phase III study and submits two-year follow-up safety and efficacy data on all participants for ValRox. 

> If approved, ValRox would become the first gene therapy for any type of hemophilia, a market which industry analyst GlobalData expects to be worth over $9.3 billion by 2028.",1

"I’m all for them taking their time and getting it right. Something about gene therapy just makes me uneasy. Even If I have to go through a year of immune suppressants and side affects and it does work,  I’d still rather keep doing what I’m doing. There are too many unknowns for me to feel comfortable with it.",1
"I don't know.  EVERY product for hemophilia is tested with ABR as part of the test data.  Be it the long acting products or Hemlibra or the new generation of TFPI blockers, this data point is in all of them.  It doesn't matter if your level goes up if you still bleed.  The problem this poses for gene therapy is that most of the patients will have been on prophy for while and their personal ABRs will be low due to that making statistical analysis of ABR reduction difficult if not impossible.  Hard to say that a 20 year old guy who has an ABR of 1-2 over the past 5 years while on prophy would have had some higher number without it as a significant number of patients have variable bleeding rates (some bleed frequently and have very high ABRs and others go months without one and can artificially lower their ABR.)",-1
"Wow.

This seems kinda messed up:
> Having previously agreed with the Agency on the extent of data necessary to support the BLA, the FDA introduced a new recommendation for two years of data from the Company's ongoing 270-301 study (Phase 3) to provide substantial evidence of a durable effect using Annualized Bleeding Rate (ABR) as the primary endpoint.  The Agency first informed the Company of this recommendation in the CRL having not raised this at any time during development or review.",1
They tried to get me to try a gene therapy ultimately I decided the clinic is to far to make it practical with all the visits. But man all the side effects and immunosuppressants and such. While we have covid 19 running around. I’m like I’m almost 32 dosing once every four days with Eloctate. Will gene therapy really make my life that much better at this stage? I’ve already got the joint damage and I just had an ankle replacement. But otherwise the Eloctate is doing what it’s supposed to do an keeping me from bleeding. Gene therapy isn’t going to give me a significant boost to QOL IMO.,1

They will offer high wages for the work being done, and they will ""hire"" you by telling you that you are hired, rather than going through the normal process that a company takes when hiring an employee in your country.

Ok so looking at this most recent financial communication from BioMarin.  
  
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/biomarin-bmrn-q1-earnings-beat-135801067.html  
  
By what I read here is that sales for Q1 beat estimates, though they were down because of the pandemic similar to other companies, though down more than average. The company expects to be net positive in revenue this year.  
  
So what is the big deal?????? Well it looks like they will resubmit for approval in EU for gene therapy this year (JUNE), this would still make them the first gene therapy product potentially being approved world wide. That has implications for appearances and confidence which could drive up the stock price no matter how much they are able to charge per dose in Europe. ALSO they are expecting potential approval of another big drug, Vosoritide in Q3 in EU and now Q4 in US. This would be the first drug used for achondroplasia, which is basically BioMarin's bread and butter as authorities have pressure to accelerate approval of drugs that work for children with rare diseases.  
  
Next lets look at the stock price. Take a look at the average stock price over the last 5 years....it has basically been hovering around 75-85 dollars, that price could be expected as the baseline now without the approval of Gene therapy and achondroplasia drugs, so how much would the stock go up with those approved???? Well its max was 131 when they got news from the FDA they needed more data to approve the gene therapy drug so what else do you need to know how the stock will react.

Tell me what you think, it seems like its a company on the cusp of finally getting over the hump financially or at least worth taking a bet on as the stock is in a lull right now.",1
MSD making simple difficult,-1
"These all match up perfectly with everything I've heard.

Biomarin used to be called Shagbally because everyone was riding, but I'm not sure if that's the case now",0
Agree with Regeneron - think I’ve PTSD from working there. Site head has the worst reputation too. He’s a snobby prick. Treat contractors like shit no wonder they can’t hold onto them,-1
My impression of Pfizer is that they are ruthless but efficient,1
Still like that - but isn’t all pharma 🤣,0
"Regeneron  I've never worked there, but I have heard enough to know I will never work there. 

Agree with J&J, pay contractors well below market rate. I interviewed for what sounded like a very interesting role that matched my skills and experience, told them my expected rate before the interview and after they offered me the role at something like 15 or 20 per hour less the rate they were given (my recruiter added a few euro onto the rate I told them). J&J wasted everyone's time there. 

On the other hand, I think MSD are one of the better payers at the moment. Although I heard about crazy high contracting rate for a project in Pfizer cork recently.",1
"Oh I definitely do too. I had some contractors reporting into me and it was scary what management made me do. Like I had to fire one guy after 3 days and I wasn't told the reason. Also was verbally abused in and outside of work but someone who is now at AD level, of course because of his reputation in work as a brilliant manager HR and my department head did absolutely nothing. Shit company, shit pay. I hope eli lilly drain them of staff.",1
Rates are crazy high at the moment because places just can’t get people. I know someone recently hired for a CSV role at 70 an hour - crazy amount but a pretty specialised area,1

Better start budgeting.,1
This is obscene.,-1
How do you budget $2-3m?,0
"I think it depends on how long the treatment lasts (specifically, how many years of bleed-preventing FVIII expression) compared to how much a person's current therapy costs to the insurance company. If you currently use $500K worth of FVIII every year and you will get 6 years of bleed-free coverage, the math seems to work.",1
25000 per month for that goal.  Easy.,1
"It's wild that a Hem A gene therapy may be approved in a few short months in the US. What a long, strange trip GT in hemophilia has been.",1
Lets hope for good earnings.,1
This’ll be an informative week for consumer staples. I’m really interested in seeing Target’s….they got hammered last May and have been in this sideways channel ever since.,1
So much free info and I still can’t work it in my favor 😆,1
