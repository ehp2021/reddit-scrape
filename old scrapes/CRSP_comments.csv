"Love to see some actual DD, was pouring over the sec filings myself and it looks good, would definitely go long on this. Here's my only concern, this treatment would essentially lead to the end result, and rather quickly by the look of it, of curing the patient, correct?

To you and I this is fantastic news, but to wall street is it? They have even been vocal about the fact that there is more money in prolonged treating of patients than a wham bam cure. As unethical and disgusting as this is, it's the facts that they prefer to keep people sick and essentially have them keep their subscription to the healthcare system by just keeping them going with expensive treatments and pills.

"CRSP here. Yea, the PD is as hard as it seems as this designation is a professional certification that is backed by education, experience, and skill/knowledge. 
You don't mention what your experience in OHS is, so it's difficult to know what to suggest.
The CRST may be a better first step (provided you meet the criteria). They don't permit candidates to write if you haven't been working in H&S more than 50% or have only peripheral involvement in OHS processes (eg sitting on a H&S committee, or working in operations where OHS (hazard assessments, program developments, etc).  
Have a look at the international standards that the BCRSP has adopted, set forth by INSHPO (also known as the Singapore Accord) to determine what skills/competencies are needed. https://www.inshpo.org/
There is a self-assessment tool and a competency map that should help determine what is needed to achieve certification.",1679266343.0

I did a prep course for the CRSP exam years ago and I highly recommend taking it about 6 months before you plan on writing. It helped me distill the competencies and what was needed in each category and organize my studying. I was able to focus my attention on areas I was not great at.

"Do you live in Canada?   I’d question why bother if you don’t.  I imagine most safety professionals would recognize these as being lateral credentials if you chose to move or work in the other country. 

As a CSP and CIH holder, I dislike how many things I need to do to maintain the certs.  I’m all for continuing education, but the cost of it and the timeline is often not reasonable when adding to my existing workload. 

My point is that I caution people to get credentials like this just for the sake of getting them.  It comes with a price of your time and wallet, which is often not attainable while balancing other career/life priorities.  If you see added value to your career, then go for it.  I just don’t see the added value to the average safety professional.",1666810481.0
I agree.  I hold both the CSP and CIH and the CEUs seems like another full time gig.  I need 8 hours by end of year for CIH…..wish me luck,1666831991.0
Thanks for your informative response. I am an American working in the Middle East. Having both certifications here is definitely a greater recognition for a safety professional since I deal with a diverse workforce.

Do you think that the CIH is a better option for me considering I am still in my twenties?,1666811827.0
Many Indians are taking the CRSP exams nowadays. Not sure why.,1666859180.0
Good luck!  I’ll probably let mine expire.  I haven’t seen the return on my investment with it.  Employers mostly care if you can make/save them money. The credential doesn’t do any of that except help validate your opinion on things.  At least that’s the case for my career path.,1666841517.0

Basically, they all ran to the moon a long time back when everybody thought that gene editing was going to be a goldmine like none other. They've all been getting clobbered because the early results are suggesting that this whole gene editing thing is going to take WAY longer to bear fruit that anybody realized.

You know how all these long-term holders like to talk about holding a stock for 10 or 20 years, well, these companies might need that sort of runway to really start seeing the products that people are eventually hoping comes out of this.

In science financial conflicts of interest are heavily considered and can seriously impair a researchers ability to publish papers. Ultimately that makes it difficult to get funding which makes it difficult to be a scientist. My PhD coursework went so far as to formally advise us to try avoiding holding any investments in any companies whom we work with or use the products of. Companies like CRSP have a lot of employees who are also full time researchers so as the company?'s value has increased the need to consider the impact of what being a shareholder and employee of the company has on their FCOIs and ability to continue doing science. As investers going all in on a biotech company should be scary. The same is true for scientists. While the pay is definitely higher to work for a biotech company, the risk of bankruptcy is something serious to consider.

- How to match a date from an annual or quarterly report to the date for a price or return. For this, there are several methods. One is to assume it takes a certain number of months for data in the annual or quarterly report. Some people assume 4 or 5 months. Then add this number of months to the date of the financial statement data, and obtain a price for this date.

"I've always thought this would be a much better metric. I understand that profits are important for studios, but I'd much rather hear how many people saw the movie, not how much they paid. A movie ticket can cost anywhere from $5 (at second run theaters on discount days) to like $20 for a fancy theater.

It's fascinating to me that movies back in the 40s, 50s and 60s had a much wider net - more people went and saw each release, probably because there were a lot fewer options (both at the theater and for entertainment in general).

"Even tickets sold is not really a great benchmark, because of a number of factors:

* Population growth: the 1930 US Census had a population of 122 million; the 2020 Census showed a population of 331 million. That benefits modern movies since there are so many more people to buy tickets.

* Increased entertainment options: in the '30s there was no streaming, no video games, no video rentals, (essentially) no TV - certainly no cable or HBO. This means if you wanted to see a particular movie, you *had* to see it in the theater. It also means movies had less competition. Both of these factors benefit older movies. 

* Ticket prices don't necessarily undergo inflation at the same rate as the general economy. There will be times when tickets are relatively cheap (benefiting those movies in terms of tickets sold) and times when they are relatively expensive (hurting those movies).

I don't think that's quite right. People wanted a ""social network v Kings Speech"" quasi-culture war fight framing but 

If they were shocked, it was because [Fincher didn't win director](http://abcnewsradioonline.com/entertainment-news/las-vegas-oddsmaker-the-kings-speech-is-favorite-to-win-best.html) after being a modest favorite to win despite King's Speech's position.

[here's a forbes aggregate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2011/02/23/oscar-odds-are-on-the-kings-speech/).

I think this disproves /u/quasifun's claim that Social Network had zero buzz (it clearly finished second in best picture) but King's Speech had it strongly in hand for a while.  Other places suggested the early frontrunner was Social Network but that seems up for reasonable debate. Both of these films would have been obviously included in earliest best picture handicapping.

People circlejerk against King's Speech because Social Network is still [considered a great film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC%27s_100_Greatest_Films_of_the_21st_Century) which was ahead of its time in backlash to social media/facebook and King's Speech just has to settle for being a well loved blockbuster that no one treats as one of the ___ greatest films of all time/greatest film of the decade (though that might slightly overstate socal network - neither cleared the high bar of making S&S's list of top 250 films all time in 2022 including the expanded critics pool).",1678816454.0

"I find these two moments emblematic of lovers and haters of the movie.

As a lover, I’ll briefly say:

“Racism is bad so let’s steal a car” scene is a masterclass in comedic subtext. And it resonates with the black experience of cultural expectations (“If you’re gonna think I’m a gangster whether I am or not, might as well be one”). Far from something didactic as “racism = bad.” If you took the scene at face value, I wholeheartedly agree it would be incredibly stupid and naive. But there *is* more going on. 

The fake gun part is a genuinely emotional moment. We and the audience genuinely believe that girl was shot and killed, and Michael Pena gave a career best performance of the father to really sell that storyline. But if you thought that first scene was dumb, then nothing after it would change your mind about anything else including this scene.

I’ve also found haters thought Matt Dillon was supposed to be sympathetic? He comes off the worst imo. But he’s also shown doing the most heroic things in the movie. A bigot saves someone he hates. How do you feel about a character like that? That’s “Can you respect a bigot for doing heroic things and feel that he has pain?” I would call that the opposite of “racism = bad.” Bigots aren’t mustache twirling villains like portrayed in almost literally every movie ever. Crash portrays him in a three dimensional light while still condemning his character.

Best Pic winners Driving Miss Daisy and Green Book both handle racism *way* more two dimensional than Crash does. How is “There are racists and we are the good guys for not being racist” more dimensional than Crash?

And off I’ve gone again down this road. Oh well. I need to eat. I probably will feel better after I eat my chicken nuggets and tater tots. Cheers!",1679010586.0

If you’re an MCU fan and you’ve been led to believe your whole life that a movie is only as good as the amount of money it makes and that their movies are better than other movies only because they do better at the box office, then you’d be more inclined to dismiss the box office performance of movies that you deem inferior. “How could Gone With The Wind make more money than Endgame” festers in their brain as “Gone With The Wind is better than Endgame” and that leads to a conscious urge to downplay the box office of Gone With The Wind. It’s the same reason why so many Marvel and Star Wars fans took such personal offense to Avatar movies surpassing their favorite movies at the box office. They thought it was a referendum on how good their movies actually are.

Expect this phenomena to only get worse. The more corporatized and IP-driven the industry becomes, the more we’ll see people blurring the lines between art and commerce in film discourse.

And you’re right about certain movies getting dismissed due to their popularity with girls.

"I don't pay attention to every company that uses crispr.  Find a crispr company and look at their pipelines.  You probably only want the ones that are using crispr as a laboratory tool to modify cells ex vivo.  You're basically probably going to find most things related to things  blood disorders and cancer, where liquid cells can be harvested, edited, then put back in.  

Companies focusing on other genetic diseases where they're going to have to deliver crispr using viruses, nanoparticles, etc. in vivo have a much more mountainous task to overcome. Curing a disease that requires in vivo editing is like several orders of magnitude more difficult from a science and regulatory perspective.

The bar for using crispr on plants and animals is relatively lower in many regards.  I dunno who is big into that atm, to be honest.  But that's a big application (ag/livestock) where regulatory hurdles are lower.

EDIT: on secind thought, any companies focusing on using crispr in vivo for eye diseases might have a better shot at curing a disease in vivo, simply because the eye is pretty self contained in terms of immunogenicity and the quantity of tissue you'd need to correct for a genetic disease of the eye is a lot smaller.

"Their earnings look high because of a one time payment by Vertex to buy an additional 10% of their SCD drug. Past this point they will only burn cash unless they make more partnerships. They are an early stage biotech so this is expected. 

But prior to investing in an early stage biotech make sure you understand what you're investing in. Early stage biotechs are an easy way to get burned if you don't know what you're doing.

I said this on another thread but I'll say it here again. Don't get so caught up with CRISPR and the tech that you forget that Crispr is not the product. This is a cell therapy company right now. Their clinical drugs at the moment are a stem cell treatment for SCD and a few CAR-T therapies. So make sure you understand the competitive landscape for that. I know that SGMO, EDIT and BLUE are all also working on SCD therapies and there are lots of CAR-T companies. 

They have In-Vivo gene therapies in development as well but they're all in discovery. From discovery to BLA filing could take a decade assuming they even work and again watch the competitive landscape for gene therapies. Lots of big players in the GTx space. 

Understand the timing. Their most progessed drug is Phase 1/2. It'll be 5+ years before they file BLA and that's assuming that it even works or that no competitor produces a superior product at that time. If they need more cash at any point during this time. They will offer more shares to fund themselves. Not uncommon for these early stage biotechs to dilute a lot. 

Cell and gene therapies are an exciting space. But these early stage companies are a crapshoot at best and I think retail investors caught up in the gene editing hype are overvaluing these companies.",1637032811.0

"Let me try to explain this amazing opportunity from a valuation and forward looking stand point. 

Valuation:

$CRSP's cash position alone is worth $52 per share. That means you are actually paying only ~$31 for ALL of the IP and assets own my Crispr TX AG, which is INSANELY cheap. 

With 2.5B in cash and equivalents and a $120M quarterly burn rate, the balance sheet is healthy.

What's in the pipeline: 5 Therapies already deep in clinical trials.

CTX-001 - Late clinical stage with amazing data - Estimated BLA submission and FDA approval for 2022. 
CTX-110 - PhaseI/II Clinical Trials
CTX-120 - PhaseI/II Clinical Trials
CTX-130 - PhaseI/II Clinical Trials
VCTX-210 - PhaseI Clinical Trials

What's not mentioned in the press documents but on interviews :

New state of the art manufacturing facility recently up and running in Framingham MA. This is very under appreciated as this will allow $CRSP to rapidly move from lab experiments to at scale production. Will also allow for rapid prototyping and iterative development of the next generation of their therapies. That along side with FDA's new framework of allowing INDs within parent INDs means $CRSP can move very quickly and iteratively. Forming that closed feedback loop that really drives modern engineering and innovations. Per Dr. Kulkarni, ""This notion of rapid prototyping has happened in the tech industry, but hasn't happened yet in the biotech industry but we are bringing that into practice.""

Another advantage of $CRSP is also in drug discovery/massively parallel screening. Per Sam Kulkarni: ""What would have taken 1 million mice to do experiment on different cuts and pairs edits, we can now do in a thousand mice due to our usage of AI/informatics.""

Some billionaire once said, ""Prototypes are easy. At scale manufacturing is hard. At scale manufacturing at profit is excruciating."" $CRSP is the only company so far even mentioning their manufacturing capabilities or anywhere near that phrase of growth. 

TLDR: This is an exciting time for CRSP as they are clearly transitioning from concept to product at scale. The emphasis on manufacturing I feel is massively under-appreciated.

"Crisper refers to a technique that can be used by anyone. Crisper is actually a naturally occurring phenomenon that occurs in bacteria. This phenomenon was described by one academic group from Berkeley and shortly following this discovery another independent group from Harvard applied it to a mammalian system. Originally, the crisper technology was used as a molecular biology technique at a basic science level to create unique cell lines, etc. What CRSP is trying to do is apply this technology for clinical applications. There are several challenges as you can imagine and frankly for this company to go all in on crisper is risky, but huge reward if/when it works. They are working with other pharma company's like vertex I believe so there can be a greater chance of success there. Honestly this is how pharma goes it either works and you have it.... Or not.

EDIT 1: It is CRISPR not crisper ty for the catch.",1615945790.0
"Yes.  

Consider things like software.  You may not own the license of something that is open source like Linux but could create your own derivative product, and provide services around it.  Red Hat Linux comes to mind.  

This is a totally intangible field, and nearly anyone with a little saavy could create and become a solutions provider, assuming they have enough talent and desire.

You can even mow your own lawn, using a Craftsman mower, and you can sell your services as well, making money.

Point is that even if you don't own the underlying technology, services and capabilities being provided can cost money.

E.g.  Private auto mechanics.",1615945567.0
this is why if you want a slice of the crispr market i would go for an etf like arkg because its too early in the business phase to play it out with individual stocks as its too risky since no one company is succesful into implementing it out to the real world. as far as i know crispr isnt big yet,1615948859.0
They’re partnered with Bayer and have a huge concentration of researchers. Talent investment is my guess.,1615946812.0
"I'd also like to add that for a lot of biotech, they spin out of technology developed by people at academic institutes. For example, professors and researchers will create the technology and be named in the patent, but because they work for a university, the university owns the patent. This is all stipulated when you're hired/enrolled for school. 

Companies can be started by the creators, but they'll license the technology from the university. I believe this is the case of CRSP.

But it's not just startups that do this. Large companies like Bayer, Pfizer, etc will also license technology or therapeutics from universities. They just don't have the manpower or resources to study everything they want to, so it's good business to find academics who have and license it.

"As another commenter suggested, I go with ARKG. It’s wayyyy too early. I saw another comment mentioning that CRISPR will end organ transplant rejection? Sure, but if that takes so long to develop that it doesn’t occur in your lifetime or occurs when you’re really old, why invest in it? I’d invest in a broad genomics ETF like ARKG to capitalize on what I think are going to be the real money makers in the field in the next couple decade: genetic sequencing and bioinformatics, while still having a stake in CRISPR (there’s been a HUGE rise in prevalence of single-cell genetic sequencing and advanced bioinformatics amongst biomedical scientists (am earning my PhD in Bioengineering, see it every day)). While CRISPR has had a huge impact and will continue to have an enormous impact, I think media hype and oversimplification is often confused for change-the-entire-world-in-a-decade type potential. That being said, if people are excited about something, price will go up in the short term whether the company changes the world or not, so maybe do invest. But there’s a lot of growth yet to occur in the industry - bugs in the BASIC science of CRISPR are still being worked out, let alone meaningful widespread clinical translation (although there has been some clinical translation). So there are still many decades for companies to rise and fall, new companies to become the “big players.” If you are going to invest in a single company now that’s purely CRISPR based, I do think CRSP is the move. But it seems a bit risky for me.

"Advantage? I believe they don't have one.

When it comes to scienceing, especially with CRISPR--Cas9, is that it's really, really hard. In this specific case pretty much hit and. So this publicly traded company just has to keep sciencing like crazy to science a science. In the meantime the other scientists at several other non-public (the best ones, IMO are not public) and public companies are sciencing. So while no doubt these scientists are scienceing their science, there's also the next guy scienceing their science and, in this case in particular, they're all throwing darts in the dark hoping to hit bullseye, patents or no.

"So as a Molecular Biology student that often study’s the use of CRISPR this is a major misconception. CRISPR has and will be extremely effective in altering cell lines as you stated but the application is not “clinical” overall it’s literally finding the exact gene in the millions of genes of our genome, that for example causes over proliferation (cancer) or causes a autoimmune response channel to stay open(lupus). So in short, the application of CRISPR is already present it’s now just the thousands of trials that must be done on different cell lines to find these vital genes. It is also significantly more complex than that but for simplicities sake I’m gonna leave it at that.",1615959446.0

"Fellow molecular and cell bio student. My school literally has a lab class I’ve taken on trying to use CRISPR on an organism to see a visible mutation. Cancer is probably a bad example for targeting with CRISPR just because cancer tends to mutate like a mother fucker. Grabbing mutations like they’re achievements in “Plague Inc.” to the point where it’s likely that a stage 3 cancer has the identity of about 15+ cancers even if it’s localized to 1 organ :( CRISPR is really good at targeting a single type of gene so we see some actual therapeutics already being tried (see: sickle cell anemia cured in a patient, and hopefully other single nucleotide mutation-causing diseases [muscular dystrophy and the like]). Some other reasons why CRISPR, the silver bullet that it is, isn’t as popular in therapeutics: “off-target” changes in your DNA, and ethics. Off target changes are pretty rare but imagine trying to fix a gene with an intricate Apple Maps system, only for Apple Maps to send you else where and absolutely wreck your body. Ethics: what if these changes affect the gonads! Now we’ve created genetically modified humans with little understanding of how that can affect future generations. Food for thought! Id still buy a couple stocks with what savings I have 🥴",1615978266.0
"As somebody in technology and having a basic understanding of AI, would you say CRISPR is dependent on ""training data"" for AI alogorithms or is it something different.

"So yes and no, and that’s the hardest part. So in some diseases you theoretically could do this, and would need even less individuals if you identified the specific cancer gene, as you can specifically test said gene further to determine its use in the disease or process. With cancer though this becomes very complicated because many different genes may be activating/inhibiting and just overall interacting with one another to create the outcome we see. At some point I strongly believe self-learning AI will be able to recognize the patterns and ways cells interact more effectively than humans do now. This being a reality would be a game changer and allow us to determine significantly more about diseases, and the way cells even work and dare I say it maybe one day cure cancer.

"Any ideas as to what could be expected, price target wise, out of EDIT in the next year or so? Been eyeing them for a few months now. How would you guess that they might compare to a comparable investment in CRSP in that time frame? 

Given what Ive been led to believe is the potential of the cas9 tool in the years to come (and thats quite a lot of potential even if being extremely conservative in the considerations), I cant help but think that all stocks related to its use will (on the whole) see a rise, so in a way, any investment in the a company utilizing it will pay out to some degree. But, having spent some time watching how the market seems to treat these things, I am somewhat afraid that that the best gains might be missed by not investing in the stock that goes by the same name as the technology itself (at least in common parlance).",1607212911.0

"It depends on the disease and average time to outcome metric. For example, if you open any cancer study you will see 5yr survival and recurrence rates published over and over, and unsurprisingly many cancer trials dont finish until they can publish 5 year survival and recurrence rates (usually about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled). The trial CRSP just did was for sickle cell in an effort  to genetically modify the patients to no longer have the trait... since this has never been done before, only CSPR can give you that estimate. That said, you can open the link I provided above, paste the clinical trial number from the abstract into clinicaltrials.gov, look at the start date of the trial until now, and make an assumption about the rate of enrollment of patients (maybe year or so for a few hundred patients in a trial like this), and then from the theoretical last date of enrollment you now can estimate when they would release data, and of course this is all delayed y the time it takes them to set up a multi-institutional phase 3, which will be another year anyway.

"Andrew Fire won the Nobel for siRNAs.  siRNAs were supposed to revolutionize medicine for all sorts of terrible genetic diseases.  Billion poured into research for siRNA therapies.  That was back in the early-to-mid 2000s.  What are the results?  A lot of mediocrity.  Less than handful of siRNA therapies are currently available on the market, and pharma abandoned a lot of siRNA projects.  siRNAs are now mostly relegated to the lab as a molecular biology technique for basic research.  

There are still gigantic hurdles towards getting CRISPR based therapies translated into something that you actually sell on the market.  The holy grail is to cure someone who has a genetic disease (in vivo of course).  That's a  hell of a lot harder (for a myriad of reasons) to do than modifying cells ex vivo with CRISPR and then transplanting the engineered cells back into a person.  For now, CRISPR will likely mostly be successful only in the ex vivo modified realm.  Applications to agriculture and livestock are also a lot easier to translate.  As with any new biotechnology, there's initially a ton of hype, the problems and difficulties are identified later, people lose interest/temper their expectations, followed by another 10-20 years of trials and tribulations until a few ideas succeed (while many companies go bankrupt or quit).  But I'd definitely temper my expectations for in vivo administration to cure a disease (i.e. the holy grail).  For a short term play, OK, whatever.  But for long term outlook, the future is still a gigantic unknown outside of ex vivo gene editing.  

A smart play related to all of this are bioinformatics and instrument companies that supply all of the reagents and machines used to analyze all of the gene edited products and that are critical for the coming wave of personalized medicine.  Companies like Illumina, Pac Bio, Thermo, Agilent, etc. will all be impervious to the HRs or strikeouts of pharma, but will reap gold over the coming years because they supply everything needed for next gen sequencing and bioinformatics.",1602095008.0

I believe they’re planning to have the enrolment for the study completed by next year max, and I believe that they may not need a full Phase 3 study due to the rare nature of the diseases they’re treating.

A market cap of $8B is crazy undervalued to me. I can easily see this becoming valued at $80B within the next couple of years.

Likely some private companies too. 

Their other applications while having value are kind of crowded and unlike the T cell stuff aren’t obviously platforms. 

It is being overbought. How long will it go though? Who knows. Would much rather own FATE which is priced cheaper and is way more likely to dominate gene edited immune cell stuff.",1625273960.0

Slightly less far out are things like (pre-emptively) detecting and curing cancer (this is already in trials) or a whole bunch of other diseases, which is why I expect Genomics to largely displace the current pharma/healthcare companies faster than people think.

"Scientist here.  I'd just like to chime in since I work with CRISPR.  Practically everyone in life science research is using CRISPR technology now.  As OP stated, this is a huge technological improvement for our field and allows for all sorts of new and promising therapeutics.  However, there are still some important issues that need to be resolved before they are used more widely.  A lot of these fundamental issues are still being resolved in the academic setting in addition to in industry.  1) How do you deliver the CRISPR components so they end up editing the specific cells you want?  2.) How do you ensure CRISPR is not having off-target effects?  

Now, will any of these companies be successful?  Maybe.  I think a lot of these companies stocks rally because they are new and focused on CRISPR which is exciting.  But if I had to guess long-term, ultimately the major pharma / biotech companies will probably be the most successful in developing CRISPR therapies.   Like I said, everyone is working with CRISPR right now.  Companies like Merck or Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson likely have entire departments of people working on developing CRISPR based therapies as we speak.  For example, Jennifer Doudna (who OP mentioned just won the Nobel Prize for discovering CRISPR) is on the leadership team at JNJ.   I don't imagine JNJ would have recruited her without having longterm plans to have a major CRISPR based therapeutic division in the future.",1603433132.0

There are many issues for **in vivo** gene editing that'd take too long to discuss. 

That being said, companies with stronger pipelines for products utilizing **ex vivo** gene editing are probably going to be winners first. 

I'd focus on companies with the most mature ex vivo products.  

The holy grail would be of course to treat someone with a genetic disease that has to be done with in vivo editing.  That is still verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry far off compared to a way less riskier project where say, for example, someone uses gene editing to generate an allogeneically  derived anti-CD19 CAR T cell to create an off the shelf product (many companies are pursuing this and similar ideas).",1603418935.0

"> Most big ticket diseases won’t be amenable to this strategy.  
  

I disagree. For example, look at HIV. There were some people with a mutation that made the outside of the cell harder. This caused HIV to not be able to replicate, so they can catch the virus, but it just gets flushed out by their liver.  
This immunity was transferred via a bone marrow transplant, and a patient with HIV was ""cured"". With CRSPR, they are able to simply edit this gene and copy in the immunity. IMO, it would just take some indirect techniques like this to solve some other big ticket diseases.

"It could be an s-curve kind of thing, that we are just at the start of.

We need the ability to simulate a complete human system in a computer, to be able to make changes to that, and accelerate the results through the simulation - that will unlock truly personalized treatments for issues, or enhancements.

This is a hardware & software problem. When will we get computers to a state that can handle that workload? When will we have all the data we need to create that simulation? When will we have the software platform to run these experiments?

I predict that could happen within the next 30 years. Machine Learning is finally catching up to the promises made in the 80's and 90's.",1607270373.0
"No it doesn't, presently. That is also not what has happened here. What happen was they took patient cells modified them Ex Vivo, selected for the ones that had the correct mutation, discarded the 10's, 100's, 1000's that didn't and then put them back into the patient. 

It was why this company specifically was so interesting, they got around the premise of modification of cells in vivo, which is extremely problematic, and often has off target effects.

This all been said, CRISPR as a technology is being improved upon all the time, but the implication that something new or better turns up and replaces it isn't true. 

This technology is great if you can pull something out of a patient change it, chuck away all the times it didn't work well enough, and then put it back in, if you however need high levels of accuracy, and a significant portion of the DNA to be changed in a large number of cells, it doesn't achieve that, currently.",1607276786.0

"I looked at bluebird a while back and found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pcYlTR_mh8) in regards to the valuation being what it is.

&#x200B;

It was enough for me to pass on bluebird. I don't know nearly enough (basically an idiot) to bet against the market, so seems like super high risk with super low chance to come out on top. And CRSP is allready a speculative risk stock as is. At least it's one that the market believes in.",1618447010.0
"$CRSP will most likely reach $100B+ once CTX001 gets approved and the drug is mass marketed.

"IMO even CTX001 is highly speculative as well. CRSPR Is using the CAS 9 system to modify HPSCs ex vivo. Bluebird is using a lentivirus to modify HSPCs ex-vivo. Anytime you are editing/inserting genes, you run the risk of oncogenesis.   The same story may repeat with CRSPR’s approach.",1618788185.0

I’ve heard that with the lentivirus vector, it’s a much more blind-sighted approach. CRSP’s approach is much more targeted, which hopefully shouldn’t give the same issues as we’ve seen with Bluebird?",1618788330.0
