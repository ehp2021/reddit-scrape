"Been cashing on the biotech run for a few weeks. Love the DD, fucking love crispr, so many application. Currently balls deep in xbi though. Technically around 1.5% or something of 20k is in crispr but  no direct exposure. This makes me want to change that",1
"Crispr will either save us or destroy us. It is the future, regardless.",0
Yep and lots more #Crispr coming via $VERV $NTLA $EDIT,1
"Love to see some actual DD, was pouring over the sec filings myself and it looks good, would definitely go long on this. Here's my only concern, this treatment would essentially lead to the end result, and rather quickly by the look of it, of curing the patient, correct?

To you and I this is fantastic news, but to wall street is it? They have even been vocal about the fact that there is more money in prolonged treating of patients than a wham bam cure. As unethical and disgusting as this is, it's the facts that they prefer to keep people sick and essentially have them keep their subscription to the healthcare system by just keeping them going with expensive treatments and pills.

So this is the only thing that to me doesn't bode well for CRISPR.",-1

Remember all that talk in the early 2000's about celebrities cryogenically freezing their heads? Are they still on ice? Who's waking up Walt Disney?,-1
"If you're worried patient cured is patient lost, consider this: 1) they have more pipelines in the works 2) the $BLUE version of a similar treatment is 2.8 million dollars per patient so I'd expect similar pricing from CRSP / Vertex (40/60 split on cost and profit between the companies)

What I mean with no 2 is, I don't suppose you could actually milk a single person for more than ~3 million dollars using prolonged subscription. The effectiveness of ""wham bam"" is just priced into that tag I believe",-1

How did that go,0
"Unfortunately that boat sailed away in Jan 2021, but you can still buy low and sell even lower!",-1
"I treat this as a long term play and consider CRSP the company more posed to endure than it's competition

They got a lot of clinical stage pipelines, the Vertex collabs are just the ones that can reach the market quickest. But once the cash starts flowing regularly and the company is not just on the cash runway, they will be able to put more into other research

I am biased because I already made 40+% on my initial purchase and been averaging up but this is also why I made this DD - pile up all the reasons why I trust this company so much and am willing to see them grow over years 

As opposed to my classical regarded approach of placing a few trades a day on short term bullshit and losing money mostly",-1

"CRSP here. Yea, the PD is as hard as it seems as this designation is a professional certification that is backed by education, experience, and skill/knowledge. 
You don't mention what your experience in OHS is, so it's difficult to know what to suggest.
The CRST may be a better first step (provided you meet the criteria). They don't permit candidates to write if you haven't been working in H&S more than 50% or have only peripheral involvement in OHS processes (eg sitting on a H&S committee, or working in operations where OHS (hazard assessments, program developments, etc).  
Have a look at the international standards that the BCRSP has adopted, set forth by INSHPO (also known as the Singapore Accord) to determine what skills/competencies are needed. https://www.inshpo.org/
There is a self-assessment tool and a competency map that should help determine what is needed to achieve certification.",1
"Thanks for your response, I have edited my experience in my main post. Mainly EHS-related consulting experience.",1
"Your work sounds very interesting!
I did a CRSP prep course when I had applied to write the exam and found it an excellent gap analysis between what competencies I needed and what I actually knew.   Maybe thats an option?",1
"No, an edu email address is not enough. After you register, someone in your institution will receive the request and verify that you are with the university.",-1
"You should figure out who is in charge of the database account management at your university's business school, write them an email  and ask if you can have access. Likely, you can put their name in as a contact for approval when you are filling out the form for access on WRDS.
Edit: I'm not that hopeful about your chances, if you are only 'lightly' affiliated.",1
"I work in tech and this is about as big as it gets.  Everyone should watch Human Nature on Netflix (and maybe Unnatural Selection as well).  I like CRSP, NTLA and VRTX.  The tech works and it is actually pretty simple.",1
Do you like CRSP better than NTLA,1
"I like NTLA because they are the ones that discovered it and own the patent.  To be fair, I haven't followed all of the patent rulings on it from all of the various companies trying to use it.  All I know is that it is University of California that discovered it and their IP office is very strong.",1
"Appreciate the insight , trying to add a few bio plays to the portfolio",1
"Have you checked with the CSSE or a certifying partner (AASP, ACSA, etc)? They may be able to direct you to one.  

I did a prep course for the CRSP exam years ago and I highly recommend taking it about 6 months before you plan on writing. It helped me distill the competencies and what was needed in each category and organize my studying. I was able to focus my attention on areas I was not great at. I would 100% do it same way again (but  haha, thank God I don't have to!).  

Good luck, they're tough exams!",1
"I'm a year from doing this myself, one of my colleagues is ahead of me doing it and said the CSSE program seems to be one of the better ones. 

Please let me know which one you choose and why",1
I ended up getting the prep course from Canadian Safety. My colleague used it to pass his CRSP. Get the highest pkg for your designation. It's not easy. I think CRSP might be easier than CRST... he found his exam to be more theoretical while we have it technical.,1
"You wont be able to take the CRSP without 4 years work experience (at least as far as I understand it). 

Usually you go for your CRST first, work for 4 years, then go for the CRSP",0
What is a CRSP?,0
"join the livestream, we are talking about WETG now",1
[removed],0
cool will have a look at WETG,1
"Do you live in Canada?   I’d question why bother if you don’t.  I imagine most safety professionals would recognize these as being lateral credentials if you chose to move or work in the other country. 

As a CSP and CIH holder, I dislike how many things I need to do to maintain the certs.  I’m all for continuing education, but the cost of it and the timeline is often not reasonable when adding to my existing workload. 

My point is that I caution people to get credentials like this just for the sake of getting them.  It comes with a price of your time and wallet, which is often not attainable while balancing other career/life priorities.  If you see added value to your career, then go for it.  I just don’t see the added value to the average safety professional.",1
I agree.  I hold both the CSP and CIH and the CEUs seems like another full time gig.  I need 8 hours by end of year for CIH…..wish me luck,1
Thanks for your informative response. I am an American working in the Middle East. Having both certifications here is definitely a greater recognition for a safety professional since I deal with a diverse workforce.   I also dabble in occupational health and hygiene at my work and have previously taken IH engineering courses.  Do you think that the CIH is a better option for me considering I am still in my twenties?,1
Many Indians are taking the CRSP exams nowadays. Not sure why.,-1
Good luck!  I’ll probably let mine expire.  I haven’t seen the return on my investment with it.  Employers mostly care if you can make/save them money. The credential doesn’t do any of that except help validate your opinion on things.  At least that’s the case for my career path.,1
"CIH would show you have a more diversified skill set.  

Congrats on your CSP, though!  Great to see more people achieving that level of professionalism in our field.",1

"https://bcrsp.ca/en/ohs-collegeuniversity-programs-CRSP

This is a list of programs that allow you to become CRSP certified. Minimum program length is 2 years (except western if you have a bachelors in a separate field already) 

Note that all educational programs require 4 years of professional level experience to obtain CRSP. All educational programs on the CRSP accredited list are eligible to write the CRST certification immediately upon graduation.

Depends largely on industry - many manufacturing facilities like to see the CRSP, construction usually wants the NCSO designation. Keep in mind I'm a newbie in the field too, this is just from what I've seen and heard from the more experienced staff I've worked with. Overall, most places will hire the person with the best & most experience, but designations do help make you competitive.",1
"I already hold a trade ticket. As long as I stay in the same industry, would I with CRST be looked at more favourably than someone with CRSP and no trade ticket?",-1
"Also, don’t let lack of a CRSP hold you back from applying to anything. A trade ticket gives you a good working knowledge of industry hazards / controls and also helps you typically to build rapport more readily than a pure safety person. You could always write on your resume that you are “working towards a CRSP” which is technically true and demonstrates a drive for continuous improvement. That’s my take at least as a CRSP working in the utility industry.",1
"Hard to say, since backgrounds and experience can vary so wildly in this industry. CRSP without trades can have a bachelors in engineering, for example, or a 2 year diploma in safety from a college.

I'd say your trade ticket makes you a very good candidate, though. Experience is, from what I gather, the most important factor in hiring, and the CRST is a nice addition to show dedication to continual improvement.",1

Honestly these results dont even look bad at all… i am tempted to add,1
Your timeline should be long with this. If you OK with 2030 buying shares now could make lots of money. If you're impatient and will unload them in 6 months if it's down 20% then you probably shouldn't buy.,1
"A lot of people are forgetting their positive sickle cell disease study read out, the full results could be coming within the next year or so.

If the treatment gets approved it would be a landmark to science, in which case CRSP would explode",1
"I can't speak too much on it from a business perspective but as a PhD candidate I can say that its use is becoming increasingly prevalent, and moreover the base CRISPR/CAS9 technology has been able to be adapted for different uses than the traditional gene editing approach. I believe the technology will become as ubiquitous as things like PCR but the difference is the company pioneered the technology, is named after it, and is still curently the most known place to obtain the technology.  There is a lot of debate out about earnings trajectory but at least in terms of science there is a large amount of growth on the table. However it is a biomedical company and we all know how often those stagnate or bankrupt so, you know, take this with a grain of salt. I am personally long on CRSP and have a small holding that I have been DCA'ing through this extended dip",0
"I think under $100 is a buy level personally, will 100% buy if it ever goes below $90. I just have no idea where the stock will go in the future, hopefully up. This is super speculative. But I am a huge believer in the technology of CRISPR",1
"The real question is, if you want to make a play on this particular segment, is CRSP the actual ticker that you want? Other options include PACB, EDIT, NVTA, NTLA, BEAM and several others.

I know Cathie Woods has had large positions in CRSP, PACB and NVTA at various times. If you ever look at Yahoo Finance's screener page for Daily Losers, you'll see these companies in there a lot. Basically, they all ran to the moon a long time back when everybody thought that gene editing was going to be a goldmine like none other. They've all been getting clobbered because the early results are suggesting that this whole gene editing thing is going to take WAY longer to bear fruit that anybody realized.

You know how all these long-term holders like to talk about holding a stock for 10 or 20 years, well, these companies might need that sort of runway to really start seeing the products that people are eventually hoping comes out of this.

Once the hype bubble has burst.... does it ever really come back? Can all these stocks explode again at some point in the future? Or will it be a Boy who cried Wolf scenario?",1
I'm surprised it dipped this low for where the market is. Good stock to buy low and sell high with as it cycles quite a bit.,0
"I have been waiting for sub $100, bought a leap now and gonna see how we do with CCs the next couple of years with hopefully some gains along the way!",1
"Upgrade:

"" Piper Sandler analyst Edward Tenthoff with an overweight recommendation and $180 per share target on CRISPR (CRSP), urges investors to buy the dip.  Tenthoff argues that data “validate CTX110 and CRISPR’s allogeneic CAR-T pipeline” with the company planning to expand the study.""

I agree with this guy!:-)",1
"I bought the dip after I exited my position on EDIT, was getting so tired of the volatility of that stock and seemed more and more like a speculative gamble that won't pay off.",0
It's probably going to drop quite a bit more. I can see it dipping down to $55 within the next year. Then it will slowly go up. This is a long term hold. Overpriced right now and highly speculative.,0
Curious myself as well.,1

My bet in this space is on Caribou Bioscience ticker: CRBU which is a company started by Jennifer Doudna (mentioned on this thread).

"Take it from a guy who has had a stem cell transplant, and has examined the chance for gene therapy, just hype. Short term investment imo.

The treatments are supper toxic and would only be available to max 3% of adult patients. Basically the immune system is in the way and would have to be completely irradicated for effective treatment. A lot of specialists are working towards alternative research already.

I read a bit about it and I have major questions an believe not all available information is given to investors about risk factors.

It might be really effective in cases where newborns need treatment because the immune system isn't in play yet. But as for a mass treatment option, I regretfully think it will never get there.

I'm extremely disappointed because I could use it.

Buy the dip. Make short profit and move on.

Btw if anyone has new info contradicting this, let me know. I'm interested.",0
I bought calls once it was under 100. Bought  shares last year and sold for a nice gain it bounces off 100 every time.,1
"I made another comment but wanted to add some potential insight as to possible reasons for insider stock unloading. In science financial conflicts of interest are heavily considered and can seriously impair a researchers ability to publish papers. Ultimately that makes it difficult to get funding which makes it difficult to be a scientist. My PhD coursework went so far as to formally advise us to try avoiding holding any investments in any companies whom we work with or use the products of. Companies like CRSP have a lot of employees who are also full time researchers so as the company?'s value has increased the need to consider the impact of what being a shareholder and employee of the company has on their FCOIs and ability to continue doing science. As investers going all in on a biotech company should be scary. The same is true for scientists. While the pay is definitely higher to work for a biotech company, the risk of bankruptcy is something serious to consider. As such if I were an insider I would personally be trying to ensure I have the ability to continue actively researching as well so that if anything were to happen to the company I still have a career.",1

New data concerning chromothripsis may affect the long-term outlook of companies such as Crispr Therapeutics.

I think the big thing is that it’s less effective than conventional CAR T cells. But to me it’s quite promising and the safety data appears to maybe outshine the standard CAR approach,1
"Everyone should give ""The Code Breaker: Jennifer Doudna"" (the inventor of crispr tech) by Walter Isaacson, and see how groundbreaking this tech is. It may be years until we see massive development in this tech, but it has so much potential, and should be a long long term play at the very least. I'm thinking 10+ years as well.

A shorter version, the first episode of ""Unnatural Selection"" on netflix talks about this as well.",1

"I’ve seen this as well, however I heard that insider selling isn’t always something be worried about.

Many executives are paid in stock options and shares to avoid the higher income rate of tax and pay capital gains instead, so perhaps that is what is going on.",1
The correct answer.,0
They look fantastic to me... I think there's going to be a big bounce as analysts digest how good the results really are.  Or maybe they're going to buy first and upgrade later...,1
"But then what you're saying is a disciplined long term investor should hold off and buy for 20% less in six months, or perhaps hold off until 2025 or 2028 even?",0
What’s PCR?,0
My formal education is in biology and I believe CRSP has a major advantage over those other tickers - first mover advantage. They're all cheap right now so may as well go with the OG,1
"I prefer the testing and sequencing companies because this tech is already widely used for detecting somatic and germline variants, but it would also benefit from some of the further out advancements.",1
"I own PACB under $25 and I also started my CRSP new position about $110.  I’m good to hold these for the next decade and I’m also going to get back into EDIT which is on sale again.

good call,1
"One of the main positives of this data was that it was not nearly as toxic as conventional CAR T cells, which is promising. Also, CRSP is not a one drug company, they have many products in development, so I don’t think this is super terrible long term news. They didn’t perform as well as conventional CAR T cells, but given they are an allogeneic treatment, that might be to be expected, and it seems to me like these could be scaled up more easily than autologous CAR treatments that rely on isolating T cells from every unique patient",1

"No, because you don't know if it will go lower or not. You buy now and buy more if it dips further. What I'm saying is that short term we don't know if it will go lower or not. So if you're the type that will sell if you see it lower 3 months from now then you should not get it. It is a good price today compared to what it will be in the future but gene editing tech still has a lot of ground to cover before it really takes off. So if you buy be ready to hold til 2030. That way you win for sure.",1

That sentence can be true, and it's possible that CRSP, PACB, EDIT and everybody else are 10 years too early to the party, and then when the party really happens, those tickers no longer exist. I'm not trying to rain on your parade with that statement, I'm just sayin, this segment has a megaton of risk, cause it's such a far off into the future payday

"Certainly and there are plenty of companies using crispr technology. What I like about CRSR is the partnership with Vertex, which is already highly profitable from their CF drug, and their focal point being treatment for sickle cell and beta thalassemia. I know there are other options like NTLA and they recently had some success with a drug for transthyretin amyloidosis, but that is more of a disorder of the elderly with a slow onset. It also has multiple FDA approve treatments already. I feel confident in CRSR, but I could be wrong too. Either way, gene therapy will be a thing and some of these stocks will boom",1
Thanks.  But my understanding from the phone call that CRSP was much safer than the ALLO.  Did you happen to listen?  I'd value your opinions.,1

I would break your problem into two parts:
- How to match Compustat permno (a security level identifier) to a Compustat gvkey (a company level identifier). For this  use the CRSP permno to gvkey linking table.

- How to match a date from an annual or quarterly report to the date for a price or return. For this, there are several methods. One is to assume it takes a certain number of months for data in the annual or quarterly report. Some people assume 4 or 5 months. Then add this number of months to the date of the financial statement data, and obtain a price for this date. 

Ex. For financial data for the year ending 12/31/2020, obtain the stock price from 5/31/2021 (or the last trading date of May 2021). This is just an example.",1

They have other meds on the market now that are FDA approved and I would want her to try those but NO!! Not cause she doesn't want to try them but because they aren't covered by insurance and cost like $10,000 a month for the medicine.

I hear you.  It's a frustrating situation.  I can understand her not wanting to spend money and also her fear of new tech.  But I hope she'll still support getting the cure approved by the FDA so that people who DO want to try it will have the option.,1

For the longest time I thought it was GWEN-why-var without properly reading it to see how it should phonetically be pronounced.,0
"In the books when someone pronounced it drizz-it , it’s a sign they don’t know drizzt or it’s a joke",1
My boyfriend insists its Gwen-it-why-var,0
"As someone who uses the name in everything I do online, I have it spelled *slightly* differently than how it's written in the books, but I pronounce it the same. How I pronounce it, it sounds like Gwen + Jennifer - the Jenn sound and changing the -fer sound to a -far sound. Putting it together you get GWEN - i - far.

Drizzt I pronounce as one syllable, and it closely rhymes with list or cyst, with the dri sound at the beginning. I suppose it would be DRIsst for pronounciation purposes.

Hope that helps!",1
Salvatore himself said Drizzt would rhyme with Kissed.  No idea on the kitty though,0
"I always pronounced it drizz-t with the hard T just like the other guy in here says he does. But for Guen Ive always said it GWEN-H-WHY-VAR. the H is likein the word HOW, and it leads straight into the W",1

"Drits
Guen-wyvar",0
"I used to say guen-why-var but when I heard Salvatore say guen-nih-var, I like that better. 

I don’t like the way he says DRIZZt, I like to say Drisst. Drizzt with an abrupt z end isn’t smooth. But Drizzt with an (s) sound is very smooth.",1
"No I’m the books drizzt is referred to by town folks who haven’t met him as the drizzit probably because they do not speak drow and haven’t heard him or others say his name properly his is a figure of folklore more most people in the early years of his time on the surface later in his life he is quite popular and people know his name but in the early years his name to the people is the drizzit even though his proper name is drizzt

Right. I actually liked Salvatores' take on it. He said it is however you want to read it. Whatever makes the story flow for you is the correct way. He just wants you to enjoy it.,1

"Guen is called ""he"" in the Icewind Dale Trilogy only. RAS explains in (I think) the Collected Stories that he always intended her to be female but, according to the roll playing game, such magical entities had no gender. So he wrote her as genderless but that was changed to male by an editor to make it read better. It was corrected for the Homeland Trilogy",1
Yeah and it had it in quotations indicating it was a weird way to say it :P oh well haha,1
THE DRIZZIT IS TRUE!!!,1
That's hilarious lol I love it,1
Thanks for clarifying it.,1
"And it was made very clear afterwards that Drizzt associated that pronunciation with the monster they think he is. Salvatore really doesn’t like people using that pronunciation, at least he didn’t back when Icewind Dale came out and people said it wrong. Thus the monster affiliation in Dark Elf Trilogy",1
"I don't remember that being made clear in the books. I just thought it was a mispronouncing of his name by people who didn't speak his language (like me). I've been reading them so long and pronouncing it one way, idk if I'll be able to change how it sounds In my head :P sorry Salvatore!",1

Clark Gable in It Happened One Night is looking like Andrew Ryan in that poster.  I wonder if he was the true one who brought Rapture?,1
I was almost yell about gone with the  wind lol,1
Personally I hate Titanic and Forrest Gump is pretty dumb as well. Gladiator was a cool movie with great action sequences but not Best Picture material either.,-1
"Shakespeare in Love is so undeserved. Saving Private Ryan was robbed.

Fuck you Weinstein for manipulating the awards. Also fuck you in general, I hope you rot in jail",0
400m for Gone with the Wind in 1939? Holy hell,-1
"Gone with the wind ought to be #1 if you account for inflation the total is $8,660,480,624.45, way more than Titanic at $4,204,660,458.60 in 2023 with inflation. Suck it Titanic!!!",-1
The departed did not win..am I right? It should have by a mile,0
movies haven’t hit the same lately. i feel like i used to consistently love 2-3 of the nominees each year,1
Good. Blue Pochahontas is such a stupid movie. I’m glad they didn’t win any awards because that movie was so unoriginal and boring. Also I suppose cultural appropriation is cool if it’s 400 million dollar blue people cultural appropriation??,1
What about Star Wars?,-1
"I’ve only seen five of these movies, odd to think about",-1
"Can we start counting these by number of tickets sold, restricted to 1st year of initial run, like every other industry? Gross is meaningless without adjusting for inflation.",-1
This list would be more interesting if the gross was adjusted for inflation,0
Now let me see adjusted for inflation,0
"I wonder if instead of box office earnings, movies were ranked as per the quantity of cinema goers like it's done in France. It tells you the number of people as opposed to the money it brought in. Because ticket prices for Casablanca vs ticket prices for Titanic wouldn't be the same.

I'm not sure all these ratings account for inflation, etc.",1
Wish these were adjusted for inflation,1
"First, you shouldn't use different sources to compile a list like this because they all have different estimates. Second, you should probably adjust for inflation, which you clearly didn't do. Nearly every list that adjusts for inflation puts Gone With the Wind squarely on top.",1
Im just happy to see Gladiator up there,1
Anybody add them up and find the average?,0
Why to people do stuff like this without adjusting for inflation? Stupid.,-1
"Just for reference 1.3 million in 1931 adjusted for inflation would be 23,000,000. Coda is easily the least grossing movie of all time.",1
"Argo and Nomadland are the two best picture winners that I still go ""Wuh?"" to. Both good films. But deserving of an Oscar? No.",1
Ya no way wakanda forever was even going to be nominated let alone win.,0
I hope for the 100th Oscars they celebrate all the old winners and actors.,1
"Moonlight ♥️ 

Everytime I tell someone this is my favorite movie they’re like “really!?” But it’s just ugh amazing. I wanna watch it right now.",1
Gone with the wind in the top grossing film of all time in real terms.,0
I’m surprised Hurt Locker didn’t make more,-1
If you adjust inflation gone with the wind would be the top,1
Why are posts like this just not a link to Letterboxd list? Haha.,1
"Chronological order of films that held the record for highest grossing best picture 

1997 the titanic 2225 million.  
1994 Forrest Gump 674 million   
1990 Dances with wolves 424 million   
1988 Rain man 413 million.  
1939 Gone with the Wind 402 million. 

1936 The Great Zigfield 4.7 million.  
1929 The Broadway Melody 4.6 million.  
1935 Mutiny On the Bounty 4.5 million.  
1927/28 Wings 3.8 million",1
"/u/SanderSo47 Excellent post!

can you make (or give me a link to info) about these adjusted for inflation?

Surely CODA is the on the bottom of the list of all time in that term",1
What year dollars are these in? If the Lost Weekend made $11m in 1945 that is about $170m in 2022 dollars.,-1
92 has the wrong picture,-1
This would be interesting adjusted for inflation,1
Coda won best picture? I had no idea,1
I love the historical tour through the graphic arts.,1
cool,1
Green book?!,0
And Titanic is the only one still earning. Since this post it has added +$500K to its total.,0
Is this list adjusted for inflation? If so it'd be surprising some films like It Happened One Night did so poorly.,1
Nomadland made a bizarre amount of international box office. Domestic was less than 10% of its worldwide gross.,-1
I forgot that Nomadland won best picture. Or never knew.,1
I can’t believe how much greenbook made and how little coda did.,0
I'm surprised Titantic won best picture. Big blockbusters don't typically win Oscar's like Best Picture.,1
Was it rereleased after the Oscars? I remember the first time I heard about it was after it won best picture.,1
"It made a lot of money after it won the Oscar and it was low-key doing well numbers for a long time cause it kept getting steam as ""this will win the oscars""  vibe and I think around this time the director was announced as joining Marvel too so.

I am pretty sure it stayed in top 15 for a long time cause it kept adding theaters and stuff and it started in just a handful? idk if i remember correctly",1
"Nice find, thanks. So it would be 88th on the list.

For some reason, neither BOM, The Numbers, Variety nor any other outlet reported its numbers, while every other winner has available numbers. I wonder why.",1
"Tickets sold is a much better metric here given that these movies span almost an entire century. It essentially adjusts the box office total for inflation & ticket price.

For anybody who doesn’t want to click, the top 10 are:

1. Gone with the Wind (1940)
2. The Sound of Music (1965)
3. Titanic (1997)
4. Ben-Hur (1960)
5. The Sting (1973)
6. My Fair Lady (1964)
7. The Godfather (1972)
8. Forrest Gump (1994)
9. The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957)
10. Around the World in 80 Days (1956)

And the bottom 10 are (lowest selling at #1):

1. Sunrise: A Song of Two Humans (1927)
2. CODA (2021)
3. Nomadland (2020)
4. The Hurt Locker (2008)
5. Moonlight (2016)
6. Birdman (2014)
7. Spotlight (2015)
8. The Artist (2011)
9. Parasite (2019)
10. 12 Years a Slave (2013)

Really changes the list. Not a single movie from this century in the top selling ones. Meanwhile, all of the lowest selling ones except for 1 are from this century.",1
For some reason it made loads of money in China which gave it a big boost,1
I was surprised too but it was a real crowd pleaser with the general public even though it’s hated on Reddit,-1
Imagine a movie like that making that much now.,1
I absolutely love that movie and do not understand the online hate it gets. Is the hate just that people hate royal family movies?,-1
The Social Network was robbed. Who the hell even talks about the King's Speech these days.,-1
I’m shocked it’s number 5.,-1
"I'm not surprised at all. Gone with the Wind is a pop culture phenomenon and juggernaut. It's one of the best-selling books of all time, created mythos and lore that literally shaped global perspectives about the Civil War and the Antebellum South, and created story beats and character archetypes which have influenced hundreds (if not thousands) of stories since then.",-1
"The fact that people continually spend time talking about the ""highest grossing movies"" without adjusting for inflation is what's insane.",-1
"It was a different time, with few other entertainment options.   Going to the movie was a weekly event because that was the only time you were looking at a screen at all.  It's really hard to compare tickets sales from that time to ticket sales today, where you might see a few movies a year.",1
"It's all re-releases. If you stop at 1950, you end up with ~44M DOMESTIC or 35M if you look at the film's first 4 years or so of release. 

If we double that and say ~80M WW, you're going to be in the middle of the pack around Lawrence of Arabia.

It made about 90M Domestic in re-releases in the 1960s so we could pretend it's also a 200M WW grossing film released in the 1960s with no re-releases which would place it around 25th place (so above Rocky 1).


[here's a chart](https://i.ibb.co/27JPfdQ/Screenshot-2020-07-13-at-14-07-46.png) from a box office forum ""gone with the wind"" page.

I'm too lazy to actually do the INT estimates but this keeps with film's overall 50/50 split and the film was a bit hit INT at the time.",-1
"It's an Apple TV+ exclusive, so absolutely nobody watched it.",0
CODA might not exist but the brand new Ipad's every academy member got in 2021 sure do.,1
"I’m so sad that CODA wasn’t advertised and marketed properly. I watched that movie with my mom and it was absolutely incredible. The acting was amazing. The story was great. It made me tear up and I couldn’t stop thinking about it for a couple days. Please, *please* watch it whenever you get the chance, it deserves so much more love than it’s gotten.",1
"CODA was the worst possible pick for Best Picture that year, absolutely abysmal choice when it was running up against films like Power of the Dog.

Also, the original French movie was better anyway.",1
It’s a good movie,1
I have never even heard of this movie.,0
it was up against DUNE and won tf? should I watch it?,1
Honestly still one of my favourite movies with how unique it is and how the story flows.,1
Winning Best Picture (or being a frontrunner leading up to it) was really a huge boost in box office when these would stay in theaters for months. I feel like Green Book was the last one to get this kind of boost,1
"Yeah I'm stunned by that one. But maybe some of that includes a post Oscar re-release, so Everything's number should rise over the next month",1
It had a very nice run both before and after the Award. I remember seeing it during the second expansion in a completely packed theater. Very cool experience.,1
"It’s also the highest grossing movie in South Korea of ALL TIME, beating out the previous record holder which was another Bong film, *The Host*.",-1
"Facts, fuck Weinstein and Shakespeare in Love",0
"Makes me wonder what the positions would be when adjusted for inflation. Got to imagine Gone with the Wind would shoot right up the list, same with The Godfather.",-1
"Apple TV exclusive, they didn’t give it much of a theatrical release before or after the Oscars",0
It's an Apple TV+ exclusive. It only had a very limited theatrical release I think.,0
"Also shares a name with a Patrick Stewart and Giancarlo Esposito movie, which had me confused for one",0
"Every other picture nominated was better. Crash was just ""Hey i'm a college freshman and learned why racism is bad. Let me explain to you why.""",-1
There’s only one Crash in this household and it’s the Croenenberg adaptation of the JG Ballard novel.,0
Still not as bad as Argo winning over Lincoln. My feeling is that the Academy gave it to the movie that was about how Hollywood helped to rescue American hostages.,1
"Crash was cool. It just wasn't as good as Brokeback Mountain, Munich, or Capote.",-1
"Maybe it wasn’t worthy of best picture, but I thought it was a very solid movie.",1
which one should have won that year?,1
American Beauty is more perplexing to me.,1
"If you want to get conspiratorial...the director of Crash (and I believe others involved in the film as well) was a scientologist, there's certainly some influential scientologists in Hollywood, especially then. There may have been pressure for Crash to win, or people who voted for Crash because of the connection.",0
The other crash was and is far superior,1
I forever refuse to believe it won over Brokeback and Munich,1
"Then again, I choose to look at the bright side: if the audience was there a decade ago, it’s still here now. We just need to find a way to make these movies accessible for them again. We might be living in a different world now, but there will always be a universal yearning for originality.",1
My parents go to the movies like once every couple years. If they go see something I know it has an appeal beyond the typical moviegoer. They saw The King's Speech.,1
"This stuff ebs and flows, much of the 1980s had the same franchise/blockbuster focus. Then came the 90s, super lucrative time for indie films. Adult oriented movies will have their day again, I have faith.",1
"I think, if a big blockbuster is going to win, it’s going to be more along the lines of something akin to a high concept Nolan film rather than a simple, fun experience. 

Everything, Everywhere, All at Once made big bucks and might be the first sign of change.",1
"I wasn’t surprised that AWOW was nominated since the first movie was nominated as well, and the ratings are similar. But I don’t expect it to come close to winning",1
Love the fact James Cameron ex-wife Kathryn Bigelow beat Avatar with Hurt Locker.,1
"$400M is the total sum the movie has earned throughout the years, not just in 1939.",0
Mid movies like this and Elvis are instant pass for a nom just cause they’re biopics. Also why tf was Rocketman which was a far better biopic not nominated for best picture? Is there an unwritten rule that the icon has to be dead or something?,-1
"No way, it’s a part of Hollywood’s history and they can’t pretend it didn’t happen. They’ve gotta live with it",-1
"The problem with that is that would mean Return of the King would also need to be revoked, because Weinstein also financed that.",-1
Absolutely terrible movie. Can't remember what movie was best that year and which mugged by Shakespeare..,1
"Same. And same with the original, La famille Bélier, despite being from a French-speaking country I don't think I know more than a couple people who've seen the movie or even remember it.",1
If you know an accurate way of doing so for worldwide grosses spanning the last 90 years go ahead. I guarantee it will either take months of full time research or you'll end up just guessing based on US inflation rates.,0
"Then the hope for the number one spot would be Gone with The Wind …

I will see myself out.",1
That was my exact thought.,0
"One word:

China.",0
It would be $182 million in today's dollars.,0
"I love this about him. He is the chillest guy, picks the most random roles, and is nominated for an Oscar every other year. He’s absolutely fantastic.",1
You'll be extra surprised when you see who was the favourite the year Annie Hall won.,1
No. Gone With the Wind would be number one with almost a billion dollar gulf between it and Titanic,-1
Looks like raw gross,0
adjusted for inflation gone with the wind is on top with over 3 billion,1
No because calculating inflation for the entire world for every country + countries that exist now + countries that don't exist anymore isn't a small peanuts kind of math problem.,-1
"You're half right. Many good movies have come out since 2011. However, the regular person (""watercooler talk"") doesnt talk about the Best Picture winner anymore unless it has to do with the La La Land flub.",1
Parasite was a really big deal,0
"For example 2022, everything everywhere all at once was in no way the best picture of the year top gun maverick and avatar 2 easily is a way better choice",1
I’m still annoyed about the Arrival snubs.,-1
Beauty and the Beast was probably the one animated movie that could win it and it was nominated the same year as The Silence of the Lambs 😢,1
So incredibly disappointing,-1
It’s pretty crazy how it’s been about 20 years since a popular movie has won the award,1
Because there’s almost none popular movies made who could be consider Oscar contenders.,-1
"For a lack of a better term, the middlebrow movies that used to dominate awards don’t perform great in theaters anymore and the writers/directors who made them focus on TV because it has more creative freedom. You occasionally get a Green Book, but it’s rare. Bobby Farrelly tried to replicate his brother’s success with that by making Champions, but it’s been ignored in theaters.

Epic blockbusters used to have a chance to win, but those movies are mostly made by committee now and aren’t great artistically. The only people left making blockbusters with distinct personality are James Cameron, Ridley Scott, and Christopher Nolan. Matt Reeves would count if he could make a non-franchise hit. There’s not a lot of output there, but it does get nominations.",1
[deleted],0
"Moonlight was one of, like, four movies in the past 15 years that actually deserved the Oscar.",1
Dude it’s tied for most Oscars won by a single film. It was a phenomenal movie.,1
"Im old haha so the LOTR films is a cultural phenomenon if I remember. Return of the King sweeping that year is the culmination of the entire franchise.

Fellowship of the Ring should have won the year it got nominated as well but I think they gave it to A Beautiful Mind.",1
Not even close,0
"rofl, yea i dont think so...",1
Cast Away was released in 2000. Gladiator beat it not American beauty.,-1
I love American Beauty.,1
There is a way you can find out,0
"Nope, it's a very standard question and one that's being asked by a LOT people in this thread. ""Inflation-adjusted"" is the term you're looking for. :)

That difference IS tracked by movie sites because it's so important, and like many I'm hoping this list will trigger a follow-up version from someone ordered by inflation.",1
"You need to see more movies. 2022 was an immensely good year. Maybe not 2019 levels of good, but better than what we got in 2020-2021.",1
You made out during… SCHINDLER’S LIST?!,0
They’re only okay.,1
Inflation,0
"I think Fellowship is the strongest, personally, although that might just be because I think it’s the best adaptation of the source material.

Return of the King is really good, but I think it REALLY needed to keep Saruman’s death scene in, it’s absence was very distracting the first time I saw it.",-1
It was pretty much straight to streaming.. Apple bought it two days after it's premiere. I don't think there was much of a screening except for awards promotion.,1
lost to Annie Hall,-1
"> Second, you should probably adjust for inflation, which you clearly didn't do

would be quite hard in this case since the info about sales overseas is missing for some movies",0
bc adjusting for inflation would be quite hard in this case since the info about sales overseas is missing for some movies,-1
Wow! I think there’s only one other movie (Resident Evil 7) with a similar domestic / foreign split.,-1
"It was released in a lot of international markets in spring/summer 2021 as cinemas were closed during the pandemic winter. 

I remember it was one of the first new releases to come out after cinemas reopened in May in the UK, and it already had the Best Picture win by then, so makes sense that it did decent numbers here ($3m, nearly as much as the US gross in a market with 10% of the cinema screens).",1
"Same, watched it with my dad a couple months ago because I knew it was nominated, no idea it had actually won.

Good film, but super depressing.",1
Coda didn’t get a fully wide release.,0
"> I can’t believe how much greenbook made

and a lot of it was from China

It released in a limited amount of theaters and on Hulu before the Oscars,-1
"Here's a non ""hard"" number find on this topic. [The 1939 ""National Box Office digest""](https://archive.org/details/boxofficedigest100nati/page/n645/mode/2up?view=theater&q=%22zola%22) (found via digitial media history project) claimed that Zola made either 135% of the gross of an average film in 1937. or 135% of the film's budget in box office rentals (""the box office business the film has averaged in american theaters"" is the description I see)



> Warner  Brothers-First  National's  only  new release  this  week,  “WE  ARE  NOT  ALONE, is  very  disappoining  at  a 92%  average,  al- most 30%  below  what  we  had  anticipated.  We were  of  the  opinion  that  if  Paul  Muni  could run  around  135%  with  “Emile  Zola.”  “Louis Pasteur,”  that  “WE  ARE  NOT  ALONE” would  not  run  very  far  behind.  We  were  evi- dently were  wrong  as  practical lv  all  the  fig- ures on  this  picture  have  been  verv  poor.

With [another link from same source](https://archive.org/details/nationalboxoffic02nati/page/n107/mode/2up?q=zola) giving his grosses for the year. Variety claimed he was the second highest grosser of the year for WB above Fairbanks (note this version's ""131%"").

"I've always thought this would be a much better metric. I understand that profits are important for studios, but I'd much rather hear how many people saw the movie, not how much they paid. A movie ticket can cost anywhere from $5 (at second run theaters on discount days) to like $20 for a fancy theater.

It's fascinating to me that movies back in the 40s, 50s and 60s had a much wider net - more people went and saw each release, probably because there were a lot fewer options (both at the theater and for entertainment in general). Movies today are competing with a dozen other excellent movies, as well as high-quality tv shows, internet creators, video games, books, etc, vs in the 60s when there wasn't as much to do.",1
"Even tickets sold is not really a great benchmark, because of a number of factors:

* Population growth: the 1930 US Census had a population of 122 million; the 2020 Census showed a population of 331 million. That benefits modern movies since there are so many more people to buy tickets.

* Increased entertainment options: in the '30s there was no streaming, no video games, no video rentals, (essentially) no TV - certainly no cable or HBO. This means if you wanted to see a particular movie, you *had* to see it in the theater. It also means movies had less competition. Both of these factors benefit older movies. 

* Ticket prices don't necessarily undergo inflation at the same rate as the general economy. There will be times when tickets are relatively cheap (benefiting those movies in terms of tickets sold) and times when they are relatively expensive (hurting those movies).

Maybe tickets sold is a better metric than pure box office, but it's still extremely limited for comparing movies of different eras.",0
"Thank you, this was the list I wanted",1
The fact that the highest vs. lowest selling movies are seemingly almost entirely time-dependent probably means that this is a worse metric rather than better,-1
"Thank you, I was wondering where Sunrise was on OP’s list!",1
"wow, no LoTR movie in the top 10?",1
"Did you calculate those or is there a list somewhere?

I'd like to see an All Time tickets sold list, and see where modern films like TFA, Avatar, Endgame fall on.",1
"Ethnicity doesn't matter in movies like Green Book.

Chinese audience are very, very fond of positive, life-affirming, heart-warming, crowd pleasing pictures. Put these themes in and have reasonably competent filmmaking techniques, you will sell very, very well in China. In fact, in China, basically every blockbuster that isn't a party propaganda these days, is this type of movie.

And Green Book did exceptionally well in it. Putting racial issues aside, you have a story about two very different men setting aside their differences and built a beautiful, supportive friendship. There's every reason why it will sell in China.

Also please see this: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/why-china-has-embraced-green-book-like-a-blockbuster-1192597/amp/",1
That's even weirder to me,0
"I didn't see it until it appeared on TV   


Based on the discourse around the film, I was expecting Birth of a Nation crossed with Triumph of the Will, but it's an enjoyable buddy movie with some interesting historical context and great performances all round",1
"White Savior movies that are so earnest you could confuse them for basic cable made for TV movies tend to do well; The Help, Blindside, Green Book... Cool Runnings.",1
The Farrelly Brothers know how to make crowd pleasers and one of them directed Green Book.,1
"At most, it'd make a tenth of that in case a streaming platform wanted to shell out that much. In theaters, well... You wouldn't like to think about that!",-1
Colin firth was famous back then,0
"I think people also dislike that it is pure Oscar bait. It's a movie talking about class issues, set during WWII(oscar voters are Greatest Generation) and talks about disabilities, but not one that is physically disfiguring. Pretty sure it also came out about a month before the nominees were decided. You couldn't get a movie more designed to win an award if you tried.",1
"A whole bunch of (primarily) American film nerds loved The Social Network and thought that should win best picture.

They completely disregarded The King's Speech and were shocked it won and have just shat on it for 13 years because they can't believe a small British indie film is better, both critically and commercially, than their fave.

The King's Speech is a modern British classic that is regularly on TV and talked about and American film nerds are still salty that it beat The Social Network.

I love both films btw.",1
The hate is mostly because many consider it to be the wrong movie to have won. And I agree.,0
"It's a good film that had the bad luck to beat a truly great one. The Social Network was truly one of the best of the decade. It's the Shakespeare in Love problem. A great film in its own right, now unfairly maligned for getting an accolade over another one. I'm so glad 1917 lost to Parasite and La La Land to Moonlight for that exact reason, the hate those two would've gotten would be off the charts. And I love those films so I'm glad they didn't get saddled with that baggage. (Although obviously La La Land got saddled with the far weirder baggage of the mess up lol.)",1
"The King's Speech is regularly on UK TV and talked about.  Everyone I know has watched it.

Both its themes (the equality of man and the struggle of those with hidden disabilities) and its subject matter (The Royal Family and a King who struggles at public speaking) are still hugely important.

It's box office run is legendary, as is its use of wideshots, Colin Firth's performance, Geoffrey Rush's performance, its set design and its dialogue.",-1
"I do.   The King's Speech was a great movie, and lends itself to many rewatches.  There's nothing in that movie I would change, and there aren't many movies I could say that about.",1
"I agree that social network was the better movie, but the criteria should never be “which movie will people talk about more”.",1
Who talks about The Social Network lol?,1
Not everyone loved it. Honestly I think Social Network is more uneven and more a technical David Fincher marvel. It's not even my top 3 or even top 5 Fincher film.,0
"The Kings Speech was amazing, a far more entertaining movie than The Social Network.",1
"It gets so disrespected nowadays because people just want their favorite blockbuster movies to surpass its adjusted box office and there is a tremendous amount of cope as to why it made the money that it did.

The only other movie I’ve seen that could be a comparable cultural phenomenon of its time is Titanic. Literally nothing else compares to just how big Gone With The Wind was.",1
Especially if you're gonna include gone with the wind which is almost 90 years old.  It's one thing not to adjust for the 90's (even though it's still very significant) it's absolutely insane not to adjust to the 30's....,-1
I saw it in theaters.,0
People are watching Ted Lasso though so a fair amount of people have this service,1
I watched it.,0
It was a hallmark movie with a bit more shine. Still can’t believe it won best picture,1
I couldn’t stand the overhyped power of the dog so I’m glad CODA won.,1
"Coda was good.  I’m surprised it won, but it was still a good movie",1
Boo coda kicked ass,-1
Yeah and thankfully it came out in a time where not everything needed a sequel or universe. The movie ended perfectly,1
Word of mouth in America was excellent on the film. There was a general hype on its release in both film circles and among general audiences that I really haven't felt since.,1
How much more money would parasite have made if not for COVID? Didn't the Oscars happen just before the lockdown?,0
"Yeah, they basically give all of their exclusive movies a one week theater run. I think CODA got some more runs later once it got nominations, but originally it was just a week.",1
"CODA is a really perfect, clever title for the film though.",1
"I only remember two things, the black people saying that racism and prejudice is bad and then they proceed to try to steal a car and when they apparently shoot the child but it was a fake gun",-1
Lol I was literally a freshman in college when this movie came out. My roommate would go on and on about how great of a movie it was. I finally sat down and watched it and was like wtf was that weird and unrealistic take on racism? I've never understood the praise around it. Glad to see that most people agree with that sentiment now.,1
"Yes. Every single time I see Crash somewhere, I think that I want to watch Spader acting in a Croenenberg movie, and then I am disappointed because it’s never that truly fascinating movie.",-1
What about the spinning bandicoot?,0
Capote at least won best actor which was basically required because of how fucking good that performance is. I can understand and be fine with it missing out on other awards as long as it won that.,1
"You’re wrong, it was offensively awful.",-1

"> and were shocked it won

I don't think that's quite right. People wanted a ""social network v Kings Speech"" quasi-culture war fight framing but 

If they were shocked, it was because [Fincher didn't win director](http://abcnewsradioonline.com/entertainment-news/las-vegas-oddsmaker-the-kings-speech-is-favorite-to-win-best.html) after being a modest favorite to win despite King's Speech's position.

[here's a forbes aggregate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dorothypomerantz/2011/02/23/oscar-odds-are-on-the-kings-speech/).

I think this disproves /u/quasifun's claim that Social Network had zero buzz (it clearly finished second in best picture) but King's Speech had it strongly in hand for a while.  Other places suggested the early frontrunner was Social Network but that seems up for reasonable debate. Both of these films would have been obviously included in earliest best picture handicapping.

**

People circlejerk against King's Speech because Social Network is still [considered a great film](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC%27s_100_Greatest_Films_of_the_21st_Century) which was ahead of its time in backlash to social media/facebook and King's Speech just has to settle for being a well loved blockbuster that no one treats as one of the ___ greatest films of all time/greatest film of the decade (though that might slightly overstate socal network - neither cleared the high bar of making S&S's list of top 250 films all time in 2022 including the expanded critics pool).",1

"Many. It's a movie that is still analyzed to this day on its technicality and writing. Still gets imitated for its style.  Hell, One of its trailers is often considered one of the greatest trailers that's ever been put together.",0
"Social Network is among the greatest movies ever made, sorry bruh.",1
"You're absolutely right. I expect that kind of ridiculous fanboy rhetoric on the movies sub but it's always disappointing when *this* sub—a sub dedicated to discussing and understanding why movies perform the way they do—tries to constantly downplay why Gone with the Wind was a monstrously huge hit and tries to show shock or disdain for how well it did. 

I've seen people post asinine things like ""There was nothing else to see back then so everyone went to see it and that's why it did so good lolol"" and it's like. . .what an absolute L of a take for a box office sub! I don't expect everyone to have studied Gone with the Wind's success and popularity in great detail (I personally have)—but I would appreciate the users here showing a little more intelligence, respect, and nuance when discussing it. It's one of the most intense war stories ever written, one that shaped how people view the *actual* Civil War. And I am more than a little suspicious that it gets dismissed largely because its audience has always been largely female.",1
"Yes, it was a massive cultural phenomenon, but it’s also fair to recognize that it’s performance is something that can never be replicated because of its era. It’s not just that there were few other entertainment options, it’s that there was no other way to watch Gone with the Wind aside from going to the theater to see it for 4 decades after it’s release.  

The film was re-released 9 times, each time basically functioning as a “new release,” as new generations of movie-goers got to see it for the first time. Titanic or Avatar or Endgame will never have a similar experience, because everybody could watch those films at home a few months after their initial theatrical release.",1

"I find these two moments emblematic of lovers and haters of the movie.

As a lover, I’ll briefly say:

“Racism is bad so let’s steal a car” scene is a masterclass in comedic subtext. And it resonates with the black experience of cultural expectations (“If you’re gonna think I’m a gangster whether I am or not, might as well be one”). Far from something didactic as “racism = bad.” If you took the scene at face value, I wholeheartedly agree it would be incredibly stupid and naive. But there *is* more going on. 

The fake gun part is a genuinely emotional moment. We and the audience genuinely believe that girl was shot and killed, and Michael Pena gave a career best performance of the father to really sell that storyline. But if you thought that first scene was dumb, then nothing after it would change your mind about anything else including this scene.

I’ve also found haters thought Matt Dillon was supposed to be sympathetic? He comes off the worst imo. But he’s also shown doing the most heroic things in the movie. A bigot saves someone he hates. How do you feel about a character like that? That’s “Can you respect a bigot for doing heroic things and feel that he has pain?” I would call that the opposite of “racism = bad.” Bigots aren’t mustache twirling villains like portrayed in almost literally every movie ever. Crash portrays him in a three dimensional light while still condemning his character.

Best Pic winners Driving Miss Daisy and Green Book both handle racism *way* more two dimensional than Crash does. How is “There are racists and we are the good guys for not being racist” more dimensional than Crash?

And off I’ve gone again down this road. Oh well. I need to eat. I probably will feel better after I eat my chicken nuggets and tater tots. Cheers!",-1

"It’s a consequence of the “commerce of art = quality of art” mentality that seems to be marinating amongst younger people.

If you’re an MCU fan and you’ve been led to believe your whole life that a movie is only as good as the amount of money it makes and that their movies are better than other movies only because they do better at the box office, then you’d be more inclined to dismiss the box office performance of movies that you deem inferior. “How could Gone With The Wind make more money than Endgame” festers in their brain as “Gone With The Wind is better than Endgame” and that leads to a conscious urge to downplay the box office of Gone With The Wind. It’s the same reason why so many Marvel and Star Wars fans took such personal offense to Avatar movies surpassing their favorite movies at the box office. They thought it was a referendum on how good their movies actually are.

Expect this phenomena to only get worse. The more corporatized and IP-driven the industry becomes, the more we’ll see people blurring the lines between art and commerce in film discourse.

And you’re right about certain movies getting dismissed due to their popularity with girls. As someone who loves Titanic, I’ve noticed over the years how much bad faith criticism it gets subjected to due to its reputation of being a chick flick. It’s funny too coz its literally the ultimate 4 quadrant blockbuster with something in it for everyone. La La Land also gets subjected to the same thing.

I haven't watched the newer ones about Elvis, johnny cash, etc.

Anyhow.. what I mean is that to me the movie seems mediocre at best but the comments are writing like it is the best thing ever.

And now after thinking a bit , I think I understand. Back then people really used Facebook a lot and actually liked it, so maybe that's why they were so stoked?

I was never a big Facebook user myself so I guess that's why I never thought of it as anything special.

I watched the king's speech and thought it was pretty decent, and I would have preferred watching it over the social network.

Just that there’s more factors than “adjusting for inflation.” You then went on that everyone mistakes box office earnings for quality, while also arguing that Gone with the Wind deserves to be the highest earning box office film bc it’s so culturally important.

The movie deserves a lot of respect, but you’re not doing the discussion any favors. Lots of people on here made good points, but instead of engage and discuss why you disagree or provide your own sources you just shared a sweeping insult w/ someone who agrees with you to avoid the consequences insulting others.

I apologize cause I know this does sound rude, but this sub is meant for discussion of box office numbers.

"This seems like a disingenuous comment. 

Is Don’s homosexuality a plot point, yes. But movies are NOT about plot. 

Is it a theme of the film, let alone the clearly prevailing and dominant theme?

This like saying the film is about music. It’s a major plot point, hell it’s basically the foundation of the inciting incident that set up the entire structure of the “enemies to friends” trope that the rest of the story is built around, but are you telling me “piano music” is your “primary reading” of the film?

It’s certainly more thematically relevant and Don’s sexuality in the film.

They even gave the film an very literal title that ties into both the overall story and central theme.",1

The latter is far more challenging, and there are still gigatic safety and delivery issues for in vivo editing.  Again, focus on companies with stronger ex vivo editing ideas for now.

Also, many diseases do not need even 50% editing to reach curative levels. Some can be as little as ~10% in the liver and provide effective cures. I assure you, those types of diseases make a substantial part of the non-ex vivo pipeline for CRISPR players.",1
"Ex vivo is the next 5-10 years, in vivo is the following 5-10 years. Delivery is very complicated for sure (more than for the covid vaccines, as three separate components need to be delivered to each cell and localized in the nucleus at the same time), but there is a lot of focus on improving delivery and we’ll get there eventually, IMO.

"I don't pay attention to every company that uses crispr.  Find a crispr company and look at their pipelines.  You probably only want the ones that are using crispr as a laboratory tool to modify cells ex vivo.  You're basically probably going to find most things related to things  blood disorders and cancer, where liquid cells can be harvested, edited, then put back in.  

Companies focusing on other genetic diseases where they're going to have to deliver crispr using viruses, nanoparticles, etc. in vivo have a much more mountainous task to overcome. Curing a disease that requires in vivo editing is like several orders of magnitude more difficult from a science and regulatory perspective.

The bar for using crispr on plants and animals is relatively lower in many regards.  I dunno who is big into that atm, to be honest.  But that's a big application (ag/livestock) where regulatory hurdles are lower.

EDIT: on secind thought, any companies focusing on using crispr in vivo for eye diseases might have a better shot at curing a disease in vivo, simply because the eye is pretty self contained in terms of immunogenicity and the quantity of tissue you'd need to correct for a genetic disease of the eye is a lot smaller. Many gene therapies target eye disorders for those reasons.",1

"Their earnings look high because of a one time payment by Vertex to buy an additional 10% of their SCD drug. Past this point they will only burn cash unless they make more partnerships. They are an early stage biotech so this is expected. 

But prior to investing in an early stage biotech make sure you understand what you're investing in. Early stage biotechs are an easy way to get burned if you don't know what you're doing.

I said this on another thread but I'll say it here again. Don't get so caught up with CRISPR and the tech that you forget that Crispr is not the product. This is a cell therapy company right now. Their clinical drugs at the moment are a stem cell treatment for SCD and a few CAR-T therapies. So make sure you understand the competitive landscape for that. I know that SGMO, EDIT and BLUE are all also working on SCD therapies and there are lots of CAR-T companies. 

They have In-Vivo gene therapies in development as well but they're all in discovery. From discovery to BLA filing could take a decade assuming they even work and again watch the competitive landscape for gene therapies. Lots of big players in the GTx space. 

Understand the timing. Their most progessed drug is Phase 1/2. It'll be 5+ years before they file BLA and that's assuming that it even works or that no competitor produces a superior product at that time. If they need more cash at any point during this time. They will offer more shares to fund themselves. Not uncommon for these early stage biotechs to dilute a lot. 

Cell and gene therapies are an exciting space. But these early stage companies are a crapshoot at best and I think retail investors caught up in the gene editing hype are overvaluing these companies.",1

"Let me try to explain this amazing opportunity from a valuation and forward looking stand point. 

Valuation:

$CRSP's cash position alone is worth $52 per share. That means you are actually paying only ~$31 for ALL of the IP and assets own my Crispr TX AG, which is INSANELY cheap. 

With 2.5B in cash and equivalents and a $120M quarterly burn rate, the balance sheet is healthy.

What's in the pipeline: 5 Therapies already deep in clinical trials.

CTX-001 - Late clinical stage with amazing data - Estimated BLA submission and FDA approval for 2022. 
CTX-110 - PhaseI/II Clinical Trials
CTX-120 - PhaseI/II Clinical Trials
CTX-130 - PhaseI/II Clinical Trials
VCTX-210 - PhaseI Clinical Trials

What's not mentioned in the press documents but on interviews :

New state of the art manufacturing facility recently up and running in Framingham MA. This is very under appreciated as this will allow $CRSP to rapidly move from lab experiments to at scale production. Will also allow for rapid prototyping and iterative development of the next generation of their therapies. That along side with FDA's new framework of allowing INDs within parent INDs means $CRSP can move very quickly and iteratively. Forming that closed feedback loop that really drives modern engineering and innovations. Per Dr. Kulkarni, ""This notion of rapid prototyping has happened in the tech industry, but hasn't happened yet in the biotech industry but we are bringing that into practice.""

Another advantage of $CRSP is also in drug discovery/massively parallel screening. Per Sam Kulkarni: ""What would have taken 1 million mice to do experiment on different cuts and pairs edits, we can now do in a thousand mice due to our usage of AI/informatics.""

Some billionaire once said, ""Prototypes are easy. At scale manufacturing is hard. At scale manufacturing at profit is excruciating."" $CRSP is the only company so far even mentioning their manufacturing capabilities or anywhere near that phrase of growth. 

TLDR: This is an exciting time for CRSP as they are clearly transitioning from concept to product at scale. The emphasis on manufacturing I feel is massively under-appreciated.

They were profitable in 2019, but again its all funny money since the revenue is from cash infusions of partnerships and their expenses swing based on the research in which they're investing.",1

DIS is more than just a streaming platform. They're a vacation, resort, content, merchandising and franchising platform. As stated, D+ is only 7% of their revenue, but the content on D+ is so much stronger than NFLX or Paramount+.

But what do I know. Maybe DIS will fail because they won't be able to execute on their online  streaming, and as a result of COVID their theme park revenue will get hammered.

Look into the competitors too - PACBs big competitor is Illumina which is much more well established, but uses older technology.  NVTA competes with other speciality labs like EXAS, but also larger reference labs like LabCorp or Quest.

Imo, the big catalyst for PACB is going to be wide clinical adoption of long read sequencing.  Today almost everyone uses short read or Sanger sequencing for patient samples, but this could change if whole exome sequencing becomes the norm (I'm guessing it will).

"Crisper refers to a technique that can be used by anyone. Crisper is actually a naturally occurring phenomenon that occurs in bacteria. This phenomenon was described by one academic group from Berkeley and shortly following this discovery another independent group from Harvard applied it to a mammalian system. Originally, the crisper technology was used as a molecular biology technique at a basic science level to create unique cell lines, etc. What CRSP is trying to do is apply this technology for clinical applications. There are several challenges as you can imagine and frankly for this company to go all in on crisper is risky, but huge reward if/when it works. They are working with other pharma company's like vertex I believe so there can be a greater chance of success there. Honestly this is how pharma goes it either works and you have it.... Or not.

EDIT 1: It is CRISPR not crisper ty for the catch.",1
"Yes.  

Consider things like software.  You may not own the license of something that is open source like Linux but could create your own derivative product, and provide services around it.  Red Hat Linux comes to mind.  

This is a totally intangible field, and nearly anyone with a little saavy could create and become a solutions provider, assuming they have enough talent and desire.

You can even mow your own lawn, using a Craftsman mower, and you can sell your services as well, making money.

Point is that even if you don't own the underlying technology, services and capabilities being provided can cost money.

E.g.  Private auto mechanics.",1
this is why if you want a slice of the crispr market i would go for an etf like arkg because its too early in the business phase to play it out with individual stocks as its too risky since no one company is succesful into implementing it out to the real world. as far as i know crispr isnt big yet,1
They’re partnered with Bayer and have a huge concentration of researchers. Talent investment is my guess.,1
"I'd also like to add that for a lot of biotech, they spin out of technology developed by people at academic institutes. For example, professors and researchers will create the technology and be named in the patent, but because they work for a university, the university owns the patent. This is all stipulated when you're hired/enrolled for school. 

Companies can be started by the creators, but they'll license the technology from the university. I believe this is the case of CRSP.

But it's not just startups that do this. Large companies like Bayer, Pfizer, etc will also license technology or therapeutics from universities. They just don't have the manpower or resources to study everything they want to, so it's good business to find academics who have and license it.

Sure, but if that takes so long to develop that it doesn’t occur in your lifetime or occurs when you’re really old, why invest in it? I’d invest in a broad genomics ETF like ARKG to capitalize on what I think are going to be the real money makers in the field in the next couple decade: genetic sequencing and bioinformatics, while still having a stake in CRISPR (there’s been a HUGE rise in prevalence of single-cell genetic sequencing and advanced bioinformatics amongst biomedical scientists (am earning my PhD in Bioengineering, see it every day)). While CRISPR has had a huge impact and will continue to have an enormous impact, I think media hype and oversimplification is often confused for change-the-entire-world-in-a-decade type potential. That being said, if people are excited about something, price will go up in the short term whether the company changes the world or not, so maybe do invest. But there’s a lot of growth yet to occur in the industry - bugs in the BASIC science of CRISPR are still being worked out, let alone meaningful widespread clinical translation (although there has been some clinical translation). So there are still many decades for companies to rise and fall, new companies to become the “big players.” If you are going to invest in a single company now that’s purely CRISPR based, I do think CRSP is the move. But it seems a bit risky for me.

"As someone who is a clinician and has used CRSIPR in real patients, I will say they are quite aggressive. I’m a little nervous about the solid tumor trials as I don’t know if their play on CAR-T cellular therapy will be effective like it is in hematologic malignancies. With that said, their ability to do allogeneic cells would be MONUMENTAL if effective.",1

"CAS9 aka crispr bio-tech will be the next big thing, ever. for those who develope enhancements and bio science early on. think about this, the CAS9/crispr bio-science will allow the developer to END organ transplant requirements. no more issues with genetic manipulation to fix inherited family genes that could potentaly cause a plethora of early life termination.
the world could be looking at the fact of ending genetic pre-disosition of organ failure, diabetis..you name it. the question is WHO is going to get it right.

"Advantage? I believe they don't have one.

When it comes to scienceing, especially with CRISPR--Cas9, is that it's really, really hard. In this specific case pretty much hit and. So this publicly traded company just has to keep sciencing like crazy to science a science. In the meantime the other scientists at several other non-public (the best ones, IMO are not public) and public companies are sciencing. So while no doubt these scientists are scienceing their science, there's also the next guy scienceing their science and, in this case in particular, they're all throwing darts in the dark hoping to hit bullseye, patents or no.

So yeah, go ahead and invest, but fundamentally all biotech companies are risky af. I'd personally look into ones that are using CRISPR-Cas9 to non-humans, if there are any in the public space.",1

"So as a Molecular Biology student that often study’s the use of CRISPR this is a major misconception. CRISPR has and will be extremely effective in altering cell lines as you stated but the application is not “clinical” overall it’s literally finding the exact gene in the millions of genes of our genome, that for example causes over proliferation (cancer) or causes a autoimmune response channel to stay open(lupus). So in short, the application of CRISPR is already present it’s now just the thousands of trials that must be done on different cell lines to find these vital genes. It is also significantly more complex than that but for simplicities sake I’m gonna leave it at that.",1

"Fellow molecular and cell bio student. My school literally has a lab class I’ve taken on trying to use CRISPR on an organism to see a visible mutation. Cancer is probably a bad example for targeting with CRISPR just because cancer tends to mutate like a mother fucker. Grabbing mutations like they’re achievements in “Plague Inc.” to the point where it’s likely that a stage 3 cancer has the identity of about 15+ cancers even if it’s localized to 1 organ :( CRISPR is really good at targeting a single type of gene so we see some actual therapeutics already being tried (see: sickle cell anemia cured in a patient, and hopefully other single nucleotide mutation-causing diseases [muscular dystrophy and the like]). Some other reasons why CRISPR, the silver bullet that it is, isn’t as popular in therapeutics: “off-target” changes in your DNA, and ethics. Off target changes are pretty rare but imagine trying to fix a gene with an intricate Apple Maps system, only for Apple Maps to send you else where and absolutely wreck your body. Ethics: what if these changes affect the gonads! Now we’ve created genetically modified humans with little understanding of how that can affect future generations. Food for thought! Id still buy a couple stocks with what savings I have 🥴",-1
"As somebody in technology and having a basic understanding of AI, would you say CRISPR is dependent on ""training data"" for AI alogorithms or is it something different.

"So yes and no, and that’s the hardest part. So in some diseases you theoretically could do this, and would need even less individuals if you identified the specific cancer gene, as you can specifically test said gene further to determine its use in the disease or process. With cancer though this becomes very complicated because many different genes may be activating/inhibiting and just overall interacting with one another to create the outcome we see. At some point I strongly believe self-learning AI will be able to recognize the patterns and ways cells interact more effectively than humans do now. This being a reality would be a game changer and allow us to determine significantly more about diseases, and the way cells even work and dare I say it maybe one day cure cancer.

There's only one way this technology goes and the answer to that question is going to be, ""yes, of course..."".  If there are consequences, there will be plenty of unedited spawn to carry on from the inevitable mistakes.

But the fact that a large company is willing to up it's stake is a good sign IMO. Their lead pipeline candidate CXT001 is currently in phase I/II trial (https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/phase-12-clinical-trial).

I was very skeptical for the same reasons as you (I work in biotech as well and have heard that CRISPR is somewhat overhyped), but seeing some articles about patients who had received their sickle cell treatment prompted me to take another look. Thanks for posting the paper, going to read this over the weekend. CRSP and VRTX are holding a joint investor presentation on the results on Wednesday, so that could be a catalyst as well. 

IMO, VRTX > CRSP for risk to reward right now, but, there’s a chance VRTX acquires CRSP, in which that would be reversed. Check out ARKG ETF to see some other companies in this and adjacent spaces. The ARK folks really know what they’re doing, so I’ve been very happy with my investment in their ETFs and using their research to guide some single name plays.",1
"I bought 50 shares at 80 and played around with weeklies when it spiked around the Nobel prize news. Sad I missed out on this recent insane run. I’m not sure what the catalyst was. But it, BEAM and NTLA have all been killing it. If the spike isn’t large Monday premarket I’m going to sink a pile into month out calls despite 143 being an ATH. 

This tech is going to change much of medicine, eventually. Sickle cell, cystic fibrosis and other single mutation devastating diseases will be up first.",-1
"I just sold my whole 6 measly shares for a 100% gain and I feel like a fool. Ive had my eyes on this tech since 2016, and Im honestly considering pulling half of my savings account out just to restart a position. I feel so stupid, and conflicted!",1

"Can confirm. Just read the NEJM article. 2 kids w/ different types of sickle cell underwent gene editing, and after >1 year they both had non-sickle cell traits. The edited, sickle cell correcting, genes were also still active in their body. This is incredible news for the medical community and if they can continue this momentum with additional studies in other chronic illnesses we will see them either being gobbled up by Amazon for trillions of dollars or they will be the greatest medical company that has ever existed for 10’s of years to come.

Oh you are in the field. So you say. I am a moron. Isn’t it true that Charpentier and Doudna created CRSP and EDIT plus a third company im forgetting? Why is CRSP so much higher? From the little I know it seems the other companies have the right to the patents and same ownership. What am I missing. What are your favorite companies in the field. BEAM you say?

Cathie Woods is bae and I’d simp for her and her ETFs any day. Brilliant investor and tailing some of her picks have paid off handsomely. It’s time to ditch the run of the mill stocks and time to invest in disrupters,1
Their long call position premiums are insane.,-1
"The clinical trials will take a long time to finish. This is very difficult to scale, its all done by hand for the most part. The dose of reality in my brain tells me this will be a roller coaster. It will change medicine, 100%, but I think a lot of investors are not fully appreciating the length of time between now and then. Invest accordingly.",-1
"I work in the field. Ive used CRISPR for many years in my day to day research. When CRSP formed as a company I scoffed at the idea because from a scientific perspective, we know the enzyme (cas9) that does the cutting to edit the genome will induce 1000s of cuts randomly throughout the genome, this happens even with high fidelity engineered cas9s too. I figured that without fixing this aspect of the system these random mutations would have serious effects in humans. We see this happen in cell culture and some times in mice too... I was a hater, and now I'm outside looking in. 

That said, I think BEAM and EDIT have a lot of room to grow. BEAM's tech results in less off target mutations, so I like them a lot more. Their market cap is around 3B at the moment, and they just ran pretty hard Wednesday-Friday, so if they cool off a bit next week I'll look to pick up some shares.",1
AT least you have money to invest. I work at sbux. N'uff said.,0

"Run into the $180s? Id guess the $200s. Its not ""meme"" status by any means, so you should be fine. WSB will be too concerned with GME earnings next week to really pump this. Maybe another post or two per day, but not the onslaught of 100s of posts the memes traditionally produce.",0
"""now I see it on WSB"" lol",1
"Edit is good, but neither of the laureates have much to do with it anymore.

I’m bullish long term on BEAM. Beam has the best technology. It’s run by David Liu who Doudna absolutely gushes about. He has engineered CRISPR to be better",1
"I follow the science, not the business as much as I should. I only know about Doudna's company Mammoth. She undoubtedly will be on the board for quite few of these gene editing companies though. I like BEAM because the nucleases used to clip the dna have less off target cleavages, meaning it results in less unintended dna mutations. That said, for all I know they might suck at running a company. EDIT is working on some interesting diseases, but again I haven't gone through all their publications science to have a solid opinion on them.",1
"There are a lot of players, 

CRSP is first to market but may not be best. Charpentier mainly steers that company.

Doudna still steers NTLA.

Feng Zheng seems to be in charge at EDIT.

Beam is David Liu’s brainchild.

David Liu has the best technology. I think BEAM is the best long term hold. He has CRISPR with supposedly no off-target effects and it can cut anywhere",-1
Smart man.,1
"You do you. This thing could keep running, you never know. I like Cathie a lot too. I often double down on her picks and buy shares of individual companies as well as ark etfs. Im more likely to buy BEAM and EDIT than CRSP at the moment.",1
"I don't think the gene editing market will be profitable for some time. The market doesn't seem to care too much though, so you might as well make hay while the sun shines. At this point, there is no telling how much higher this could run, they are well above what they stand to make from their treatment hitting the market for sickle cell.",1
Why is Intellia a banned ticker?,-1
"It is showing an RSI of 85 which means its very overbought. However, the news came only today about the most recent success.  So, it looks like it could have a couple days of running but could then come down given such a high RSI. Do you think it is too late to buy shares? Or do you think this thing is going to run up for a while more?",1
Honestly I don’t see it going down without a financial crisis or some sort of crazy scandal. Definitely not getting in early at this point but still a lot of room to grow imo,1
"Cathie is a genius. They’re so far ahead of other firms in terms of research and tech understanding. When you look back to 2018 and hear her thoughts you realize that she was seeing the future more clearly than 99% of investors.

COVID also helped by speeding disruption, but I think we’ll see even more disruption and creative destruction going forward.",-1
VRTX or another stock?,0
With your experience can you roughly estimate that timeframe?,0
"edit: lol, understand completely. Director might be a wsb member...",1
"Any ideas as to what could be expected, price target wise, out of EDIT in the next year or so? Been eyeing them for a few months now. How would you guess that they might compare to a comparable investment in CRSP in that time frame? 

Given what Ive been led to believe is the potential of the cas9 tool in the years to come (and thats quite a lot of potential even if being extremely conservative in the considerations), I cant help but think that all stocks related to its use will (on the whole) see a rise, so in a way, any investment in the a company utilizing it will pay out to some degree. But, having spent some time watching how the market seems to treat these things, I am somewhat afraid that that the best gains might be missed by not investing in the stock that goes by the same name as the technology itself (at least in common parlance).",1

"BEAM is the best long term hold. Yes. I would high five you if I could.

NTLA, BEAM, and EDIT all are doing good things. I’m waiting for the correction to get in bigger. I love Edit’s focus on the eye and NVTA’s focus on the liver. 

VRTX basically has exclusive rights to Duchenne’s muscular dystrophy because they acquired Eric Olson’s company Exonics. He showed they could correct Duchenne’s in dogs with CRISPR, so I’m bullish.",1

"It depends on the disease and average time to outcome metric. For example, if you open any cancer study you will see 5yr survival and recurrence rates published over and over, and unsurprisingly many cancer trials dont finish until they can publish 5 year survival and recurrence rates (usually about 5 years after the last patient is enrolled). The trial CRSP just did was for sickle cell in an effort  to genetically modify the patients to no longer have the trait... since this has never been done before, only CSPR can give you that estimate. That said, you can open the link I provided above, paste the clinical trial number from the abstract into clinicaltrials.gov, look at the start date of the trial until now, and make an assumption about the rate of enrollment of patients (maybe year or so for a few hundred patients in a trial like this), and then from the theoretical last date of enrollment you now can estimate when they would release data, and of course this is all delayed y the time it takes them to set up a multi-institutional phase 3, which will be another year anyway. Like I said - this will take time. Likely another 2-3 years, if I had to guess without doing the shit I discussed above.",-1

"The more reality sets in, the less stocks like this will pump. This is all based on speculation and grandeur. For example, anything related to EVs, business in space, quantum computing, or any highly disruptive technology will pump hard based on any news that makes it closer to reality. Once reality sets in and products are on the market (assuming there aren't more reasons to speculate, ie tsla's situation), that is when the real valuations take effect (ie crash of dot com). My guess is if any of their pre clinical work makes it to clinical trial they will run hard, just like CRSP did.",0

"Andrew Fire won the Nobel for siRNAs.  siRNAs were supposed to revolutionize medicine for all sorts of terrible genetic diseases.  Billion poured into research for siRNA therapies.  That was back in the early-to-mid 2000s.  What are the results?  A lot of mediocrity.  Less than handful of siRNA therapies are currently available on the market, and pharma abandoned a lot of siRNA projects.  siRNAs are now mostly relegated to the lab as a molecular biology technique for basic research.  

There are still gigantic hurdles towards getting CRISPR based therapies translated into something that you actually sell on the market.  The holy grail is to cure someone who has a genetic disease (in vivo of course).  That's a  hell of a lot harder (for a myriad of reasons) to do than modifying cells ex vivo with CRISPR and then transplanting the engineered cells back into a person.  For now, CRISPR will likely mostly be successful only in the ex vivo modified realm.  Applications to agriculture and livestock are also a lot easier to translate.  As with any new biotechnology, there's initially a ton of hype, the problems and difficulties are identified later, people lose interest/temper their expectations, followed by another 10-20 years of trials and tribulations until a few ideas succeed (while many companies go bankrupt or quit).  But I'd definitely temper my expectations for in vivo administration to cure a disease (i.e. the holy grail).  For a short term play, OK, whatever.  But for long term outlook, the future is still a gigantic unknown outside of ex vivo gene editing.  

A smart play related to all of this are bioinformatics and instrument companies that supply all of the reagents and machines used to analyze all of the gene edited products and that are critical for the coming wave of personalized medicine.  Companies like Illumina, Pac Bio, Thermo, Agilent, etc. will all be impervious to the HRs or strikeouts of pharma, but will reap gold over the coming years because they supply everything needed for next gen sequencing and bioinformatics.",1

In my opinion, CRSP is the furthest along in the gene editing space and the fact that they’re focused on blood diseases which are more accessible than other tissues. But like another commenter said, these are likely all or nothing. If they succeed it will be wildly lucrative, but they could also totally fail.",-1
"I can’t tell you because I haven’t researched the company extensively. I do have some familiarity with their crisper/cas9 platform, but that’s it.

My question to you though is did you have a target price in mind when you bought it? If so, what factors led into identifying your target price? If your reasoning is sound, then you can stick by your investment or dollar cost average into it. However, if you haven’t had an identifiable plan, then you’re going to be happy-go-lucky when it goes up and have anxiety or feel clueless when it drops. 

I’m not following their news, but what I can tell you is this is likely an all-or-nothing investment because they don’t have a single drug that’s been approved or actively selling yet. I’m not knocking the business, but it’s too new of a company to accurately forecast. I just think there’s too much downside for me to enter a new position atm.",0

"This is a company that has a good cash reserve, and has very promising promising products in their pipeline. Their most prominent one is CTX-001. In their investor update they had ‘a promise to making CRISPR a reality’ and the company has a very decent leadership team too.

CRSP is the only one of the gene-editing companies that I’m invested in right now. I’m currently at 2.5 shares at an average price of ~$120 and I’m planning to increase it to around 3-4 and then see how it plays out for the next couple of years.

I believe they’re planning to have the enrolment for the study completed by next year max, and I believe that they may not need a full Phase 3 study due to the rare nature of the diseases they’re treating.

A market cap of $8B is crazy undervalued to me. I can easily see this becoming valued at $80B within the next couple of years. CRSP is one of the most ahead in the game, and they seem very passionate to follow through and get it completed. I wouldn’t be surprised if it hit $1,000/share in the future.",1

Cynically, I think to an extent, there is a certain human desire to be able to ""fix"" or ""enhance"" ourselves. It's why people do botox, steroids, etc. 

Optimistically, I think the therapies will help resolve a lot of human suffering for which today there is no solution.

From an investor perspective, at the end of the day both the cynic and the optimist will be willing to pay.",1
"I disagree. Genetics is just beginning and there's definitely a good argument for current gene editing companies like Crispr and Beam blowing up in the future. Yeah they are struggling right now business-wise because we still haven't developed the abilities for humans/animals but gene editing for plants and drought resistance will be the likely next step. Once these companies take a couple more steps in the right direction, the business/investment side will pick up. If you aren't interested in ""choosing a single horse"", you could always invest in some ETFs that follow these biotech companies. I think ARKG has a decent collection?

If you're thinking of just trying to make some $$$ this year, I wouldn't do it. If you're looking for a long position (""lotto ticket"") to hold for the next 5 years, then I'd definitely think of investing. Just my opinion though - not a smart business guy.

"Looked at the chart, big oof. Wsb stocks, after march, don't touch them. Just don't. You can't even get a good intra day deal like RKT anymore.",0
"I sold CRSP & BEAM yesterday. I still believe they are good long term holds and will dominate the medical industry in the future (I currently work cancer research, and previously worked in bioinformatics/genomics) - however it’s going to be a long time. There will be many trials that will inevitably fail along the way and I believe there will be another low buying point in the next few years before it really takes off. I put the vast majority of my investing money into funds that I don’t manage, so I was happy with the profit I got yesterday for selling and will keep an eye on the price for the next couple years.",0
"I sold some of my CRSP on Monday after the 9% rise because I found a way to invest in ARKG and I'm not comfortable stockpicking in the genomics space. I'm still holding 1% of my portfolio in CRSP and PACB, and putting 6% in ARKG.

I wouldn't sell it just because of this rise though. The market cap is at $12.5B. If the bull case is right, the biggest genomics companies will replace companies like J&J and have market caps in the $500B-2T range in 10-20 years. That said, if you're thinking of rebalancing your portfolio or really want to take some gains of the table (not a fan of this personally unless you have something you need the money for), this seems to be a good time.",1

I think crisper is following modernas trend. Regeneron up in there too. I wouldn’t sell. Add if there’s a dip. These companies are set to transform healthcare 🤞🏽,0
"I think they are way overhyped vs other players leveraging gene editing tech for other applications, and they are overhyped mostly because their name is Crispr. Their immuno oncology tech won’t be better than other companies who are more cutting edge on it (notch/allo as well as maybe fate even for the cytotoxic T cell stuff).  Likely some private companies too. 

Their other applications while having value are kind of crowded and unlike the T cell stuff aren’t obviously platforms. 

It is being overbought. How long will it go though? Who knows. Would much rather own FATE which is priced cheaper and is way more likely to dominate gene edited immune cell stuff.",1
"Nope. This was just the first in what I believe is a long range of products coming from this approach/innovation.
Hold and buy the dips",0
"As a genome engineer, I can tell you that this technology is very effective, classical drugs often fail as they don’t translate so well between mouse and human but with Crispr the translation is seemless. EDIT have clinical data next",1
"As a medical professional, IMO we’re not even close to the full potential or CRSP. Wouldn’t sell for the next 5-10 years.",0
Thanks man!,1
Sorry dude :/,-1
"
What is a good price to buy CRSP at? It's at $80 today.",1
"I’m in the same boat. I love CRSP, it’s on my watch list for any corrections, and it’s still too speculative for my blood.",1
"Thanks for your helpful response. I am expecting CRSP to reach about $100B once CTX-001 becomes a widely available treatment, that would mean the stock price would be >$1000.

A market cap of $500B-2T would be incredible. What makes you think that CRSP will overtake companies like JNJ which use conventional methods of medicine? CRSP is mostly based on gene-editing, so they’d focus on genetic disease unless if I’m missing something?",1
"
What is a good price to buy CRSP at? It's at $80 today.",1
"This makes no sense. If the genomics bull case is right, they could easily go up 10x within 3 years. Even in a crash they're never coming down 95%. You'd be much better off DCA'ing.",0
"dw, was locking in profit due to macro environment, i still like the company, it is just a bit too far into the future right now...",1
"Gene-editing isn't limited to genetic diseases. Although it's much further out, eventually (probably within 50-200 years although this is very difficult to predict) you could cure anything through gene editing. Even stuff like aging or the fact that you're not as fast as Usain Bolt.

Slightly less far out are things like (pre-emptively) detecting and curing cancer (this is already in trials) or a whole bunch of other diseases, which is why I expect Genomics to largely displace the current pharma/healthcare companies faster than people think.

Oh also, keep in mind that $2T in 2040 will not nearly be as large as it is today. The biggest company 20 years ago was less than $500B.",-1
"Personally I think if you're willing to hold 10 years, any price is a good price to buy at today. My biggest worries with CRSP is that like any other genomics stock, it's difficult to predict which company will succeed and which will not make it.",1
"I agree with this, it’s better to average down than try to time it correctly. Likelihood is you’ll end up losing some gains along the way.",1
That’s just what i’m doing. The idea that I might miss my opportunity while the stock is sitting at ATH doesn’t make sense to me. I’d much rather put my money in another company instead of buying a genomic stock at ATH. I’m talking about NTLA of course,1
Not 95 but definitely thirty to fifty percent. All it takes is one bad trial.,-1
"Very great insight, thanks so much :)",1
That would be more than 200 years. You would need to study several generations to know the impact of gene editing on humans.,0
"Ah, so you're investing in other genomics stocks, just not the ones that are at ATH? I suppose that could make sense.",0
"So like I said, it needs to drop 90% in that scenario to be back to today's value. If it drops 30-50% you would've been much better off DCA'ing.",1
"Ehm, no. That's exactly how gene editing doesn't work. Once you figure out what certain genes do, you no longer need to study the long term effects on individuals.",-1
"No i’m not investing in any of them right now. I have a bias towards a market pullback in the near future so I am waiting. These stocks tend to move together, like most recently when ntla pulled all the other stocks up with it. So i am just simply waiting for a large pullback in the market. Yes, DCA may be the better option, but to me, the pullback seems obvious.",1
You don't know what you're talking about.,0
"Crashes always seem obvious, and they never happen. Until they no longer seem obvious.

Of course you need to do what you feel comfortable with, but statistically you're gonna be worse off.",-1
You do realize that gene editing is already approved in medicine today right? So how do you need to study multiple generations before you can use it? You think they started studying it in the 1800s when we didn't even have electricity?,1
"Gene editing is approved in medicine ?? So if i have some issue they will alter the gene for me to resolve it?? You sound ignorant equating small trials to approval. Like I said, you do not know what you're talking about.",1

"Usually remote access is a no. Subscriptions are generally negotiated on student fte, and they stipulate that you need to be an affiliated user for remote access. However, many libraries (especially at public institutions, at least in the u.s.) do offer on-site access to the vast majority of their databases. This is because they use some amount of public monies in the procurement of those databases, so they try to make them as accessible as possible within the guidelines of the contract. You should call your local public institution to see if they have this database, offer community access on-site, and double check on covid protocols. Some universities require that you use one of their terminals to access databases, while others provide wifi access.",-1
"For something like these you might struggle without paying something.  Any commercially valuable data, such as WRDS, Mintel, Bloomberg, etc. are only accessible by current staff/students in an academic setting. It's stipulated in the licencing terms.

"Scientist here.  I'd just like to chime in since I work with CRISPR.  Practically everyone in life science research is using CRISPR technology now.  As OP stated, this is a huge technological improvement for our field and allows for all sorts of new and promising therapeutics.  However, there are still some important issues that need to be resolved before they are used more widely.  A lot of these fundamental issues are still being resolved in the academic setting in addition to in industry.  1) How do you deliver the CRISPR components so they end up editing the specific cells you want?  2.) How do you ensure CRISPR is not having off-target effects?  

Now, will any of these companies be successful?  Maybe.  I think a lot of these companies stocks rally because they are new and focused on CRISPR which is exciting.  But if I had to guess long-term, ultimately the major pharma / biotech companies will probably be the most successful in developing CRISPR therapies.   Like I said, everyone is working with CRISPR right now.  Companies like Merck or Pfizer or Johnson & Johnson likely have entire departments of people working on developing CRISPR based therapies as we speak.  For example, Jennifer Doudna (who OP mentioned just won the Nobel Prize for discovering CRISPR) is on the leadership team at JNJ.   I don't imagine JNJ would have recruited her without having longterm plans to have a major CRISPR based therapeutic division in the future.",1
[deleted],0
"I'd temper expectations.  

There are many issues for **in vivo** gene editing that'd take too long to discuss. 

That being said, companies with stronger pipelines for products utilizing **ex vivo** gene editing are probably going to be winners first. 

I'd focus on companies with the most mature ex vivo products.  

The holy grail would be of course to treat someone with a genetic disease that has to be done with in vivo editing.  That is still verrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrry far off compared to a way less riskier project where say, for example, someone uses gene editing to generate an allogeneically  derived anti-CD19 CAR T cell to create an off the shelf product (many companies are pursuing this and similar ideas).",1
Buy all of them.,0
"One thing to think about in this space is that a lot of the treatments in phase I are fairly rare compared to heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's.   Intellia's most advanced therapy NTLA-2001 is for transthyretin amyloidosis, which affects 1 in 100,000 people in the US and 1 in 538 in Portugal, where it is most common.   Fewer customers =  less profit.  I'm not a bear but it's worth thinking about",1

"Personally, I think the wide use in academic and industry research labs makes it particularly risky to pick a company because it's based on CRISPR technology. I see it going forward as more of a tool for research rather than a therapeutic intervention, but I could be wrong. Regardless, if i really wanted to invest in one of these companies, i would make sure I'm convinced by their specific platform and applications, rather than just being attracted by CRISPR itself.",1
"Jennifer, from what I hear, is uninterested in the business of science.  And while many companies are working on crispr, they still need to access the IP.  Many have partnered already.

I have worked in big pharma and a Crispr company.  Don't bet on big pharma.  They suck and they know it. That's why they'll wait and see.",1

"Isn't all this priced in already? I've been hearing about CRSP this and CRSP that for at least a month now and it's been on a rocket ride since the start of November.

I feel like it's oversold and about to correct down at this point.",1
I actually saw your previous post and added CRSP to my watchlist and noticed it going up last week. How much upside is left with this thing?,0
what about its little brother NVTA,0
"you are correct, it's primed to launch up and I am out of buying power atm......how do you get in on pre market stuff, what kind of strategies/rules are there?",0
"I like the idea of leaps for CRSP and maybe shorter term for EDIT, minimizes risk",0
"What a garbage DD post, not even DD. BAN.",1
Hell yeah baby! Let’s get it! Glad to see someone else here keeping an eye on that one. It nearly never gets brought up.,-1
Dang I didn't even know crspr was publicly traded.,0
"No idea where it can go short term (next few months). But long term, well, I’m holding my shares and not even thinking about it for a long time. It’s already doubled from when I bought just after their offering a few months ago.",1
Been watching that one for a couple months as well but don’t know much. Check out the link posted by u/mynameispdt for a more thorough write up and the other companies in the same field.,0
They are not the same at all!,0
"You can’t buy options pre market. What broker are you using? I’m thinking there will be time to get in Monday. This stock doesn’t gap up like others. I’ve noticed from following this stock and the options activity for it that with the high OI on that otm strike that’s still over a month out, there’s a very good chance that it will be itm before it starts getting too close to expiration. I hope to have enough money to actually exercise if this plays out the way I want it to so I get the shares. It’ll be my first option that I do that with.",1
Not a bad idea for CRSP. Maybe now isn’t the best time to enter with IV higher than normal though? What date you thinking?,1
"Yeah, biotech aside from covid plays has been pretty quiet here.",1
"It is showing an RSI of 85 which means its very overbought. However, the news came only today about the most recent success. So, it looks like it could have a couple days of further running up but could then come down given such a high RSI. Do you think it is too late to buy shares? Or do you think this thing is going to run up for a while more?",1
"I bought in the money calls for RIOT at 6$ and will do the same. I'm just curious how pre-market action works

I have RH but may use TD Ameritrade for IPOs and boring dividend stuff, unless y'all know a better group

If my NIO AND Xpeng calls bounce up and I pull a profit, I'll be looking to BB a little. I'm just surprised people haven't seen the value in SPCE since they got their NASA work co tract approved and have a Lot of US gov money headed their way in 2021",1
"True, might make more sense to wait until it settles a bit, but I think long term gains could make up for a potential IV crush. I'm tempted to get in ASAP just because I can see a lot of hysteria pumping the stock in the short term before a level off, I want to lock in those gains... I'm sure it will experience more periods of high IV that might be even higher than the IV it's currently seeing (which is high, yeah, but the stock traditionally has high IV).  Probably leaps for 7/16/2021 or Jan 2022 (they're expecting more clinical trial news sometime in 2021). Not sure though, it depends how crazy things get before open Monday. I'm on the fence. Might just buy some shares Mon and hope for a drop in IV  to get into 2022 leaps.",1
Just read everything and checked out EDIT. That looks like a safer play than CRSP if I’m going with options.,1
"Which is a bit funny, because years and years ago it was HUGE on here. When Martin Shkreli used to post DD on here is was all about biotech.",1
Biotech is very unpredictable... even good tech and good clinical data can get fda rejected,1
Are you looking at the 6 month rsi? I want to get in and get out of this one. I’ll be following th me volume and OI closely to see if and when the selling starts.,0
Or get into the 1/15 160c and roll into leaps once IV (hopefully?) dies down some,0
Load up on EDIT shares instead,1
"This is pharma, so don't load up on options unless there is a clear catalysts to drive the price up like expected trail results occurring before you expiration date. EDIT is mainly pre clinical at the moment, except for 1 phase 1/2 trial. Time your plays around those dates.",1

Yep... hoping for the best for us tomorrow!! I'll update ya when / if I end up rolling into 2022 leaps,1
It will rally until you buy it.,0
"I don't understand this kind of thinking. If you're thinking of buying CRSP (or any genomics stock) right now, you'd better be in for the long term. And if you're in for the long term, you're betting on this stock going 10x from here AT LEAST. So how big is the chance it will dip 10% before it's gone up another 10%?

You're just trying to time the market to get a slightly bigger gain at terrible odds, while risking to lose out on massive gains. That makes no sense to me.",0
"Buy PACB instead, it's also rallied but it being the main position of ArkG might pump it up higher and even quicker.",0
Gene editing is the future. Everyone is waiting for that correction.,0
"Their work is inherently volatile, the dip could always come hard and fast any time should there be poor experiment results, and there will be many to come. Since you can't time that, DCA might be the best way to buy your way in.",0

I guess some very successful investor (name can't remember now ) said once in interview, good stocks never seems cheap at current price!!",1
Yeah. Tell us when you buy.,1
"I think I tend to have tunnel vision at times i am a long term investor, and with that being said I think part of my problem is “trying to time the market “ I’m still fairly new to investing and this does make sense. Thanks",1

"Idk man, I bought the stock at $30 when I was first starting out but the position was so small that I took my gains at $75ish. I needed the cash to make bigger trades at the time but it feels so bad from a mental block standpoint getting back in now at this price.",-1
TWST is also above CRSP now in ARKG and I’ve never heard anyone talk about it,0
"My biggest holding.

Base editing is the evolved version of classic cutting Crispr",0
you da man,0
"No worries. For me the key was to always think super long term. If you're buying a stock that will see 1000% gains or more over the next 10 years, does it really matter that much if you buy it for 10% less (or more) right now?",1
So you just proved his point about long term.,0

"They really are. This technology allows scientists to precisely edit DNA sequences.

Add the fact that its incredibly cheap and can be done rather quickly. 

There is still a LOT of research that needs to be done in order to understand how to edit DNA to achieve the desired effect without unintended consequences. However, once (if) this technology reaches maturity it could have the potential to cure cancer or even allow humans to grow wings!

Will that ever happen? Probably not. Will it happen within my lifetime? Definitely not. 
But still fun to think about.",-1
Get ready for the GMO humans,1
Yep. Not a mouse this time,1
"> Most big ticket diseases won’t be amenable to this strategy.  
  

I disagree. For example, look at HIV. There were some people with a mutation that made the outside of the cell harder. This caused HIV to not be able to replicate, so they can catch the virus, but it just gets flushed out by their liver.  
This immunity was transferred via a bone marrow transplant, and a patient with HIV was ""cured"". With CRSPR, they are able to simply edit this gene and copy in the immunity. IMO, it would just take some indirect techniques like this to solve some other big ticket diseases.  
Disclaimer: not a doctor.",1
It’s been a good play,1
That would be like owning lockheed martin during an arms race.,1
"It could be an s-curve kind of thing, that we are just at the start of.

We need the ability to simulate a complete human system in a computer, to be able to make changes to that, and accelerate the results through the simulation - that will unlock truly personalized treatments for issues, or enhancements.

This is a hardware & software problem. When will we get computers to a state that can handle that workload? When will we have all the data we need to create that simulation? When will we have the software platform to run these experiments?

I predict that could happen within the next 30 years. Machine Learning is finally catching up to the promises made in the 80's and 90's.",1
"No it doesn't, presently. That is also not what has happened here. What happen was they took patient cells modified them Ex Vivo, selected for the ones that had the correct mutation, discarded the 10's, 100's, 1000's that didn't and then put them back into the patient. 

It was why this company specifically was so interesting, they got around the premise of modification of cells in vivo, which is extremely problematic, and often has off target effects.

This all been said, CRISPR as a technology is being improved upon all the time, but the implication that something new or better turns up and replaces it isn't true. 

This technology is great if you can pull something out of a patient change it, chuck away all the times it didn't work well enough, and then put it back in, if you however need high levels of accuracy, and a significant portion of the DNA to be changed in a large number of cells, it doesn't achieve that, currently.",1

"I looked at bluebird a while back and found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pcYlTR_mh8) in regards to the valuation being what it is.

&#x200B;

It was enough for me to pass on bluebird. I don't know nearly enough (basically an idiot) to bet against the market, so seems like super high risk with super low chance to come out on top. And CRSP is allready a speculative risk stock as is. At least it's one that the market believes in.",1
"$CRSP will most likely reach $100B+ once CTX001 gets approved and the drug is mass marketed. 

Check our Youtube channel on Gene editing companies: [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7WxxmVYSxVyP1O5Sf0b6TQ](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7WxxmVYSxVyP1O5Sf0b6TQ)",1
"IMO even CTX001 is highly speculative as well. CRSPR Is using the CAS 9 system to modify HPSCs ex vivo. Bluebird is using a lentivirus to modify HSPCs ex-vivo. Anytime you are editing/inserting genes, you run the risk of oncogenesis.   The same story may repeat with CRSPR’s approach.",1
